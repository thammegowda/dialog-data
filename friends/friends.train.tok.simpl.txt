what 's this ?
i would have to say that is an l -shaped bracket .
which goes where ?
i have no idea .

done with the bookcase

you guys .
oh , god .
you got screwed .
oh my god

oh my god
i know , i know , i 'm such an idiot . i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week . i mean , how clean can teeth get ?
my brother 's going through that right now , he 's such a mess . how did you get through it ?
well , you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers , say her-
-leg ?
that 's one way me , i- i went for the watch .
you actually broke her watch ? wow the worst thing i ever did was , i-i shredded by boyfriend 's favorite bath towel .
ooh , steer clear of you .
that 's right .
barry , i 'm sorry i am so sorry i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on , but it isn 't it isn 't , it 's about me , and i ju- hi , machine cut me off again anyway look ,

i 'm divorced i 'm only 26 and i 'm divorced
shut up
you must stop
that only took me an hour .
look , ross , you gotta understand , between us we haven 't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento . you , however have had the love of a woman for four years . four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out , and that is why we
you know what the scariest part is ? what if there 's only one woman for everybody , y 'know ? i mean what if you get one woman- and that 's it ? unfortunately in my case , there was only one woman- for her
what are you talking about ? one woman ? that 's like saying there 's only one flavor of ice cream for you . lemme tell you something , ross . there 's lots of flavors out there . there 's rocky road , and cookie dough , and bing cherry vanilla . you could get em with jimmies ,
i honestly don 't know if i 'm hungry or horny .
stay out of my freezer
ever since she walked out on me , i , uh
what ? what , you wanna spell it out with noodles ?
no , it 's , it 's more of a fifth date kinda revelation .
oh , so there is gonna be a fifth date ?
isn 't there ?
yeah yeah , i think there is . -what were you gonna say ?
well , ever-ev- ever since she left me , um , i haven 't been able to , uh , perform . sexually .
oh god , oh god , i am sorry i am so sorry
it 's okay
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now . um how long ?
two years .
wow i 'm-i 'm-i 'm glad you smashed her watch
so you still think you , um might want that fifth date ?
yeah . yeah , i do .

what you guys don 't understand is , for us , kissing is as important as any part of it .
yeah , right y 'serious ?
oh , yeah
everything you need to know is in that first kiss .
absolutely .
yeah , i think for us , kissing is pretty much like an opening act , y 'know ? i mean it 's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .
yeah , and-and it 's not that we don 't like the comedian , it 's that-that that 's not why we bought the ticket .
the problem is , though , after the concert 's over , no matter how great the show was , you girls are always looking for the comedian again , y 'know ? i mean , we 're in the car , we 're fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake .
yeah , well , word of advice bring back the comedian . otherwise next time you 're gonna find yourself sitting at home , listening to that album alone .
are we still talking about sex ?

no , it 's good , it is good , it 's just that- mm- doesn 't she seem a little angry ?
well , she has issues .

he 's out banging other women over the head with a club , while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet

oh , i think this is the episode of three 's company where there 's some kind of misunderstanding .
then i 've already seen this one
are you through with that ?
yeah , sorry , the swallowing slowed me down .
whose little ball of paper is this ?
oh , uh , that would be mine . see , i wrote a note to myself , and then i realised i didn 't need it , so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead .

she 's already fluffed that pillow monica , you know , you 've already fluffed that- -but , it 's fine
look , i 'm sorry , guys , i just don 't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have .
yes , and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child 's pillow .
monica- hi um , monica , you 're scaring me . i mean , you 're like , you 're like all chaotic and twirly . and not-not in a good way .
yeah , calm down . you don 't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .
that 's because as far as my parents are concerned , ross can do no wrong . y 'see , he 's the prince . apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born .
ew , ew , ew , ew ew ew ew ew
what ?
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster
eeaagh

oh , like i wasn 't dreading tomorrow enough , having to give it back to him hi barry remember me ? i 'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family oh god and now i 'm gonna have to return the ring , without the ring , which makes it
easy rach , we 'll find it . won 't we
oh yeah
alright , when 'd'ya have it on last ?
doy probably right before she lost it
you don 't get a lot of doy these days
i know i had it this morning , and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with
dinah ?
ohhhhh , don 't be mad
you didn 't .
oh , i am sorry
i gave you one job
oh , but look how straight those noodles are
now , monica , you know that 's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne
i just can 't do it .
boys ? we 're going in .

hi .
wow . that is not a happy hi .
carol 's pregnant .
ooh i found it
w-w-wh- wha- w-w-w-
yeah . do that for another two hours , you might be where i am right about now .
kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective , huh , mon ?
well now , how-how do you fit into this whole thing ?
well , carol says she and susan want me to be involved , but if i 'm not comfortable with it , i don 't have to be involved basically it 's entirely up to me .
she is so great i miss her .
what does she mean by involved ?
i mean presumably , the biggest part of your job is done .
anyway , they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow .
so what are you gonna do ?
i have no idea . no matter what i do , though , i 'm still gonna be a father .

well , this is still ruined , right ?

oh , martha ludwin 's daughter is gonna call you . mmm what 's that curry taste ?
curry .
mmmm
i- i think they 're great i , i really do .
do you remember the ludwins ? the big one had a thing for you , didn 't she ?
they all had a thing for him .
aw , mom
i 'm sorry , why is this girl going to call me ?
oh , she just graduated , and she wants to be something in cooking , or food , or i don 't know . anyway , i told her you had a restaurant-
no mom , i don 't have a restaurant , i work in a restaurant .
well , they don 't have to know that
ross , could you come and help me with the spaghetti , please ?
yeah .
oh , we 're having spaghetti that 's easy .
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish , but , were you planning on bringing up the whole baby lesbian thing ? because i think it might take some of the heat off me .

what that rachel did to her life we ran into her parents at the club , they were not playing very well .
i 'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money
well , at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar
what 's that supposed to mean ?
nothing it 's an expression .
no it 's not .
don 't listen to your mother . you 're independent , and you always have been even when you were a kid and you were chubby , and you had no friends , you were just fine and you would read alone in your room , and your puzzles

look , there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars , with his museum , and his papers getting published . other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i 'm telling you , these are the people who never get cancer .

and i read about these women trying to have it all , and i thank god our little harmonica doesn 't seem to have that problem .
so , ross , what 's going on with you ? any stories ? no news , no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?
okay okay . look , i , uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me , and , so , well , here 's the deal . carol 's a lesbian . she 's living with a woman named susan . she 's pregnant with my child , and she and susan are

and you knew about this ?

your folks are really that bad , huh ?
well , y 'know , these people are pros . they know what they 're doing , they take their time , they get the job done .
boy , i know they say you can 't change your parents , boy , if you could- -i 'd want yours .
must pee .
y 'know , it 's even worse when you 're twins .
you 're twins ?
yeah . we don 't speak . she 's like this high-powered , driven career type .
what does she do ?
she 's a waitress .
all right , you guys , i kinda gotta clean up now .
chandler , you 're an only child , right ? you don 't have any of this .
well , no , although i did have an imaginary friend , who my parents actually preferred .

oh a little
mm-hmm
a lot .
mm .
so , got any advice ? y 'know , as someone who 's recently been- dumped ?
well , you may wanna steer clear of the word dumped . chances are he 's gonna be this , this broken shell of a man , y 'know , so you should try not to look too terrific , i know it 'll be hard . or , y 'know , uh , hey , i 'll go down
oh , you 've got carol tomorrow when did it get so complicated ?

yeah , and we all know what a challenge that is
all right , you two , stop it
no no no , she gets a credit , hey , i 'm in there too .
ross . you 're not actually suggesting helen willick-bunch-geller ? cause i think that borders on child abuse .
of course not , i 'm suggesting geller-willick-bunch .
oh , no , nonononono , you see what he 's doing ? he knows no-one 's gonna say all those names , so they 'll wind up calling her geller , then he gets his way
my way ? you-you think this is my way ? believe me , of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being , this is not my way- y 'know what ? uh , um , this is too hard . i 'm not , i can 't do-

yeah . yeah . a little .
well , i was just wondering about the mother-to-be , but thanks for sharing . uh , lie back
you- uh- y 'know what , i 'm gonna go . i don 't- i don 't think i can be involved in this particular thing right now .

oh my god .
look at that .
i know .

well ? isn 't that amazing ?
what are we supposed to be seeing here ?
i dunno , but i think it 's about to attack the enterprise .
you know , if you tilt your head to the left , and relax your eyes , it kinda looks like an old potato .
then don 't do that , alright ?
okay

um , not so good . he walked me to the subway and said we should do this again
ohh . ouch .
what ? he said we should do it again , that 's good , right ?
uh , no . loosely translated we should do this again means you will never see me naked .
since when ?
since always . it 's like dating language . y 'know , like it 's not you means it is you .
or you 're such a nice guy means i 'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you .
or , or , y 'know , um , i think we should see other people means ha , ha , i already am .
and everybody knows this ?
yeah . cushions the blow .
yeah , it 's like when you 're a kid , and your parents put your dog to sleep , and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .
that 's funny , that , no , because , uh , our parents actually did , uh , send our dog off to live on a farm .
uh , ross .
what ? wh- hello ? the millners farm in connecticut ? the millners , they had this unbelievable farm , they had horses , and , and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- oh my god , chi chi

so how does it feel knowing you 're about to die ?
warden , in five minutes my pain will be over . but you 'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die .
hey , that was really good
thanks let 's keep going .
okay . so . whaddya want from me , damone , huh ?
i just wanna go back to my cell . cause in my cell , i can smoke .

whoah
hey
hey
alright , now try taking a puff .

alright okay . no . give it to me .
no no no , i am not giving you a cigarette .
it 's fine , it 's fine . look , do you wanna get this part , or not ? here .

don 't think of it as a cigarette . think of it as the thing that 's been missing from your hand . when you 're holding it , you feel right . you feel complete .
y 'miss it ?
nah , not so much . alright , now we smoke . oh my god .

no , no , no . they say it 's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy 's thumb to the tip of his index finger .

that 's ridiculous
can i use either thumb ?
alright , don 't tell me , don 't tell me decaf cappucino for joey coffee black late and an iced tea . i 'm getting pretty good at this
yeah . yeah , excellent .
good for me

y 'okay , phoebe ?
yeah- no- i 'm just- it 's , i haven 't worked- it 's my bank .

it 's nothing , it 's just- okay . i 'm going through my mail , and i open up their monthly , you know , statement-
easy .
and there 's five hundred extra dollars in my account .
oh , satan 's minions at work again
yes , cause now i have to go down there , and deal with them .
what are you talking about ? keep it
it 's not mine , i didn 't earn it , if i kept it , it would be like stealing .
yeah , but if you spent it , it would be like shopping
okay . okay , let 's say i bought a really great pair of shoes . do you know what i 'd hear , with every step i took ? not-mine . not-mine . not-mine . and even if i was happy , okay , and , and skipping- not-not-mine , not-not-mine , not-not-mine , not-not-mine
we 're with you . we got it .

okay . i 'd- just- i 'd never be able to enjoy it . it would be like this giant karmic debt .
chandler , what are you doing ?
hey . whaddya doing ?

oh oh , god
what is this ?
i 'm smoking . i 'm smoking , i 'm smoking .
oh , i can 't believe you you 've been so good , for three years
and this- is my reward

oh , come on come on
no . not after what happened with steve .
what are you talking about ? we love schhteve schhteve was schhexy sorry .
look , i don 't even know how i feel about him yet . just give me a chance to figure that out .
well , then can we meet him ?
nope . schhorry .

i mean , why should i let them meet him ? i mean , i bring a guy home , and within five minutes they 're all over him . i mean , they 're like- coyotes , picking off the weak members of the herd .
listen . as someone who 's seen more than her fair share of bad beef , i 'll tell you that is not such a terrible thing . i mean , they 're your friends , they 're just looking out after you .
i know . i just wish that once , i 'd bring a guy home that they actually liked .
well , you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy

let it go , ross .
yeah , well , you didn 't know chi chi .
do you all promise ?
yeah we promise we 'll be good
chandler ? do you promise to be good ?

you can come in , but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside

yes , yes like the man in the shoe
what shoe ?
from the nursery rhyme . there was a crooked man , who had a crooked smile , who lived in a shoe , for a while

so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured .
what future boyfriends ? nono , i th- i think this could be , y 'know , it .
really
oh , yeah . i 'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone . you know i 'm gonna be doing that at parties , right ?
you know what i like most about him , though ?
what ?
the way he makes me feel about myself .
yeah

hi how was the game ?
well
we won thank you yes
fantastic i have one question how is that possible ?
alan .
he was unbelievable . he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions , right , but instead of bugs it was first base-alan , second base-alan , third base-
i mean , it-it was like , it was like he made us into a team .
yep , we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball
can i ask you guys a question ? d 'you ever think that alan is maybe sometimes
what ?
i dunno , a little too alan ?
well , no . that 's impossible . you can never be too alan .
yeah , it 's his , uh , innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore .
i personally could have a gallon of alan .

hey , lizzie .
hey , weird girl .
i brought you alphabet soup .
did you pick out the vowels ?
yes . but i left in the ys . cause , y 'know , sometimes y . uh , i also have something else for you .

nooo

oh , hey , don 't do that cut it out
it 's worse than the thumb
hey , this is so unfair
oh , why is it unfair ?
so i have a flaw big deal like joey 's constant knuckle-cracking isn 't annoying ? and ross , with his over-pronouncing every single word ? and monica , with that snort when she laughs ? i mean , what the hell is that thing ? i accept all those flaws , why can 't you accept me for this

does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody ?
well , i-i could live without it .
well , is it , like , a little annoying , or is it like when phoebe chews her hair ?

oh , now , don 't listen to him , pheebs , i think it 's endearing .
oh , you do , do you ?

you know , there 's nothing wrong with speaking correctly .
indeed there isn 't i should really get back to work .
yeah , cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered .
ohh-ho-hooohhh . the hair comes out , and the gloves come on .

did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like ?
no .
okay well , i 'm going out with a guy my friends all really like .
waitwait we talking about the coyotes here ? all right , a cow got through
can you believe it ? y 'know what ? i just don 't feel the thing . i mean , they feel the thing , i don 't feel the thing .
honey you should always feel the thing . listen , if that 's how you feel about the guy , monica , dump him
i know it 's gonna be really hard .
well , he 's a big boy , he 'll get over it .
no , he 'll be fine . it 's the other five i 'm worried about .

do you have any respect for your body ?
don 't you realise what you 're-you 're doing to yourself ?
hey , y 'know , i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease . the bottom line is , smoking is cool , and you know it .
chandler ? it 's alan , he wants to speak to you .
really ? he does ? hey , buddy , what 's up oh , she told you about that , huh . well , yeah , i have one now and then . well , yeah , now . well , it 's not that big- well , that 's true , gee , y 'know , no-one- no-one 's
god , he 's good .
if only he were a woman .
yeah .

ooh , lambchop . how old is that sock ? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it 'd be talking too .
okay . i think it 's time to change somebody 's nicotine patch .
hey . where 's joey ?
joey ate my last stick of gum , so i killed him . do you think that was wrong ?
i think he 's across the hall .
thanks .
there y 'go .

you 're kidding . oh my god .
and on my way over here , i stepped in gum . what is up with the universe ?
what 's going on ?

even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear
uh , joey
oh , god

oh that was lambchop
please , guys , we have to talk .
wait , wait , i 'm getting a deja vu no , i 'm not .
alright , we have to talk .

okay . it 's-it 's about alan . there 's something that you should know . i mean , there 's really no easy way to say this uh i 've decided to break up with alan .

is there somebody else ?
no , nononono it 's just things change . people change .
we didn 't change
so that 's it ? it 's over ? just like that ?
you know you let your guard down , you start to really care about someone , and i just- i-
look , i- i could go on pretending-
okay
-but that wouldn 't be fair to me , it wouldn 't be fair to alan- it wouldn 't be fair to you
who-who wants fair ? y 'know , i just want things back . y 'know , the way they were .
i 'm sorry
oh , she 's sorry i feel better
i just can 't believe this i mean , with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family-
i 'll meet somone else . there 'll be other alans .
oh , yeah right
are you guys gonna be okay ?
hey hey , we 'll be fine . we 're just gonna need a little time .
i understand .

wow .
i 'm , i 'm really sorry .
yeah , i 'm sorry too . but , i gotta tell you , i am a little relieved .
relieved ?
yeah , well , i had a great time with you i just can 't stand your friends .

remember when we went to central park and rented boats ? that was fun .
yeah . he could row like a viking .
hi .
mmm .
so how 'd it go ?
oh , y 'know
did he mention us ?
he said he 's really gonna miss you guys .
you had a rough day , huh c 'mere .
that 's it . i 'm getting cigarettes .
no no no
i don 't care , i don 't care game 's over i 'm weak i 've gotta smoke i 've gotta have the smoke
if you never smoke again i 'll give you seven thousand dollars
yeah , alright .

would you let it go ? it 's not that big a deal .
not that big a deal ? it 's amazing . ok , you just reach in there , there 's one little maneuver , and bam , a bra right out the sleeve . all right , as far as i 'm concerned , there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close . am i right ?
come on you guys can pee standing up .
we can ? all right , i 'm tryin that .
ok , you know what blows my mind ? women can see breasts any time they want . you just look down and there they are . how you get any work done is beyond me .
oh , ok , you know what i don 't get ? the way guys can do so many mean things , and then not even care .

multiple orgasms

so , saturday night , the big night , date night , saturday night , sat-ur-day night
no plans , huh ?
not a one .
not even , say , breaking up with janice ?
oh , right , right , shut up .
chandler , nobody likes breaking up with someone . you just gotta do it .
no , i know , but it 's just so hard , you know ? i mean , you 're sitting there with her , she has no idea what 's happening , and then you finally get up the courage to do it , and there 's the horrible awkward moment when you 've handed her the note .
why do you have to break up with her ? be a man , just stop calling .
you know , if you want , i 'll do it with you .
oh , thanks , but i think she 'd feel like we 're gangin up on her .
no , i mean you break up with janice and i 'll break up with tony .
tony ?
oh , you 're breaking up with tony ?
yeah , i know , he 's sweet , but it 's just not fun anymore , you know ? i don 't know if it 's me , or his hunger strike , or , i don 't know .
does anybody want anything else ?
oh , yeah , last week you had a wonderful , nutty , chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing . nothing , just , just , i 'm fine .
what 's the matter ? why so scrunchy ?
it 's my father . he wants to give me a mercedes convertible .
that guy , he burns me up .
yeah , well , it 's a mercedes if i move back home . oh , it was horrible . he called me young lady .
ooh , i hate when my father calls me that .
did he give you that whole you 're-not-up-to-this thing again ?
oh , yeah , yeah . actually , i got the extended disco version , with three choruses of you 'll never make it on your own .
uh-huh , uh-huh .

hi , joey .
my god , angela .

no , yeah , no , ok , but not yet . i don 't wanna seem too eager . one mississippi , two mississippi , three mississippi . that seems pretty cool . hey , angela .
joey .
you look good .

don 't you have a laundry room in your building ?
yes , i do have a laundry room in my building , um , but there 's a rat problem . apparently they 're attracted to the dryer sheets , and they 're goin in fine , but they 're comin out all fluffy . anyway , say , sevenish ?
sure .

forget it joey . i 'm with bob now .
bob ? who the hell 's bob ?
bob is great . he 's smart , he 's sophisticated , and he has a real job . you , you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor , but bob

ok , bye . well , monica 's not coming , it 's just gonna be me and rachel .
oh . well , hold on camper , are you sure you 've thought this thing through ?
it 's laundry . the thinking through is minimal .
it 's just you and rachel , just the two of you ? this is a date . you 're going on a date .
nuh-uh .
yuh-huh .
so what 're you saying here ? i should shave again , pick up some wine , what ?
well , you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear . this is basically the first time she 's gonna see your underwear  you want it to be dirty ?
no .
oh , and uh , the fabric softener ?
ok , ok , now what is wrong with my snuggles ? what , it says i 'm a sensitive , warm kinda guy , you know , like a warm , fuzzy bear . ok , i can pick something else up on the way .
there you go .

thank you . so what does this bob guy look like ? is he tall ? short ?
yep .
which ?
which what ?
you 've never met bob , have you ?
no , but he 's

hey , joey .
horribly attractive . i 'll be shutting up now .

this is nice . we never do anything just the two of us .
it 's great . maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies .
eww , i don 't wanna do that .

here we go .

hey , janice .
oh , my god , i am so glad you called me . i had the most supremely awful day .
hey , that 's not good . can i get an espresso and a latte over here , please ?
we got the proofs back from that photo shoot , you know , the one with the little vegetables . anyway , they pretty much sucked , so , i blew off the rest of the day , and i went shopping and i got you , i 'm looking , i 'm looking , i 'm looking , i

what ?
what ?
what did you get me there ?
i got you these .
bullwinkle socks . that 's so sweet .
well , i knew you had the rockys , and so i figured , you know , you can wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle , or you can wear rocky and rocky , or , you can mix and match , moose and squirrel . whatever you want .
that 's great .

well , i 'm gonna get another espresso . can i get you another latte ?
no , no , i 'm still working on mine .

that 's it ?
yeah , it was really hard .
oh , yeah , that hug looked pretty brutal .
ok , you weren 't there .

comin through . move , move .
oh , scuse me . i was kinda using that machine .
yeah , well , now you 're kinda not .
but i saved it . i put my basket on top .
oh , i 'm sorry , is that your basket ? it 's really pretty . unfortunately , i don 't see suds .
what ?
no suds , no save . ok ?

what 's goin on ?
hi , uh , nothing . that horrible woman just took my machine .
was your basket on top ?
yeah , but , there were no suds .
so ?
well , you know , no suds , no save .
no suds ? excuse me , hold on a second . that 's my friend 's machine .
hey , hey , hey , her stuff wasn 't in it .
hey , hey , hey , that 's not the rule and you know it .

all right , show 's over . nothing to see here . ok , let 's do laundry .
that was amazing . i can 't even send back soup .
well , that 's because you 're such a sweet , gentle , uh do you , uh , do you oh , hey , uh you must need detergent .

what 's that ?
uberveiss . it 's new , it 's german , it 's extra-tough .

rach , do you uh , are you gonna separate those ?
oh god . oh , am i being like a total laundry spaz ? i mean , am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants ?
rach , have you never done this before ?
well , not myself , but i know other people that have . ok , you caught me . i 'm a laundry virgin .
uh , well , don 't worry , i 'll use the gentle cycle . ok , um , basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites , a whole nother machine for colors , and a third for your uh , your uh , delicates , and that would be your bras and your under-panty things .
ok , well , what about these are white cotton panties . would they go with whites or delicates ?
uh , that , that , that would be a judgment call .

he is so cute . so , where did you guys grow up ?
brooklyn heights .
cleveland .
how , how did that happen ?
oh my god .
what ?
i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling . but i 'm not .

so , you and angela , huh ?
yep . pretty much .
you 're a lucky man . you know what i miss the most about her ? that cute nibbly noise when she eats . like a happy little squirrel , or a weasel .
huh , i never really noticed .
oh , yeah , yeah , listen for it .
monica , monica is great .
yeah , but it 's not gonna last . she 's too much for me in bed . sexually .

i 've gotta tell you , bob is terrific .
yeah , isn 't he ?
it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny , and has an emotional age beyond , like eight .
you know what else ? he 's unbelievable in bed .
wow . my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity .
huh . that 's nice .

ok , you can do this . it 's just like pulling off a band-aid . just do it really fast , and then the wound is exposed .

janice . hi , janice . ok , here we go . i don 't think we should go out anymore . janice .
all right . well , there you go . stop it , stop it , stop it .

ok , i know this is gonna sound really stupid , but i feel that if i can do this , you know , if i can actually do my own laundry , there isn 't anything i can 't do .
that does not sound stupid to me . you know , it 's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself , after carol left me ? i 'm sorry , that 's all the time we have . next on ross uh-oh .
what uh-oh ?
uh-oh , uh-oh , the laundry 's done . it 's , uh , it 's a song . the laundry song that we sing . uh-oh the laundry 's done , uh-oh , uh-oh .
ross , what 's the matter ?
nothing , nothing . lee-lo , the laundry 's done .
come on , show me .
all right , all right , it 's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites , and now , everything 's kinda pink .
oh , everything 's pink .
yeah , uh , except for the red sock , which is still red . i 'm sorry , please don 't be upset , it could happen to anyone .
except it didn 't . it happened to me . oh , god , i 'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep . what am i doing ? what am i doing ? my father 's right . i can 't live on my own i can 't even do laundry

something went wrong with underdog , and they couldn 't get his head to inflate . so anyway , um , his head is like flopping down broadway , right , and i 'm just thinking how inappropriate this is . um , i 've got something in my eye , uh , joey , could we check it in

oh my god .
what ?
hello were we at the same table ? it 's like cocktails in appalachia .
come on , they 're close .
close ? she 's got her tongue in his ear .
oh , like you 've never gotten a little rambunctious with ross .
joey , this is sick , it 's disgusting , it 's , it 's  not really true , is it ?
well , who 's to say what 's true ? i mean
oh my god , what were you thinking ?
all right , look , i 'm not proud of this , ok ? well , maybe i am a little .
oh
ow
i 'm outta here .
wait , wait , wait . you want him , i want her . he likes you .
really ?
yeah . i 'm thinking , if we put our heads together , between the two of us , we can break them up .

i 'm so sorry , i can 't believe i did this , but i couldn 't stop laughing at your norman mailer story .

uh , waiter , one more plate of chicken wings over here .

here 's the thing , janice . you know , i mean , it 's like we 're different . i 'm like the bing , bing , bing . you 're like the boom , boom , boom .

it was unbelievable . i-i 've never met anyone like her . she 's had the most amazing life she was in the israeli army

luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block . so , we made it to the border , but just barely , and i- i 've been talking about myself all night long , i 'm sorry . what about you ? tell me one of your stories .
alright . once i got on the subway , right , and it was at night , and i rode it all the way to brooklyn just for the hell of it .
we talked til like two . it was this perfect evening more or less .
all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon .
oh , i 'm sorry , so we is ?
'we would be me and rick .
who 's rick ?
who 's rick ?
my husband .
ooooohhh .
oh , so you 're divorced ?

oh , i 'm sorry , then you 're widowed ? hopefully ?
no , i 'm still married .
so tell me , how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me ? sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket ?
don 't worry . i imagine he 'd be okay with you because really , he 's okay with ethan .
ethan ? there 's , there 's an ethan ?
mmmm ethan is my boyfriend .
what ?
so explain something to me here , uh , what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend ?
i suppose mainly sexual .
hm .
oh . i 'm sorry it didn 't work out .
what not work out ? i 'm seeing her again on thursday . didn 't you listen to the story ?
didn 't you listen to the story ? i mean , this is twisted how could you get involved with a woman like this ?
well , y 'know , i had some trouble with it at first too , but the way i look at it is , i get all the good stuff all the fun , all the talking , all the sex and none of the responsibility . i mean , this is every guy 's fantasy
oh , yeah . that is not true . ross , is this your fantasy ?
no , of course not yeah , yeah , it is .
what ? so you guys don 't mind going out with someone else who 's going out with someone else ?
i couldn 't do it .
good for you , joey .
when i 'm with a woman , i need to know that i 'm going out with more people than she is .
well , y 'know , monogamy can be a , uh , tricky concept . i mean , anthropologically speaking-

fine . fine , alright , now you 'll never know .
we 're kidding . c 'mon , tell us
yeah c 'mon
alright . there 's a theory , put forth by richard leakey-

tah-daaah
are we greeting each other this way now ? cause i like that .
look i cleaned i did the windows , i did the floors i even used all the attachments on the vacuum , except that little round one with the bristles , i don 't know what that 's for .
oh yeah , nobody knows . and we 're not supposed to ask .
well , whaddya think ?
very clean it looks great terrific
oh i-i see you moved the green ottoman .
uh-oh
how-how did that happen ?
i dunno i-i thought it looked better there . and i- and also , it 's an extra seat around the coffee table .
yeah , yeah , it 's interesting but y 'know what ? just for fun , let 's see what it looked like in the old spot . alright , just to compare . let 's see . well , it looks good there too . let 's just leave it there for a while .
i can 't believe you tried to move the green ottoman .
thank god you didn 't try to fan out the magazines . i mean , she 'll scratch your eyes right out .
you guys , i am not that bad
yeah , you are , monica . remember when i lived with you ? you were like , a little , y 'know , ree ree ree ree
that is so unfair
oh c 'mon when we were kids , yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn 't raggedy
okay , so i 'm responsible , i 'm organised . but hey , i can be a kook .
alright , you madcap gal . try to imagine this . the phone bill arrives , but you don 't pay it right away .
why not ?
because you 're a kook instead you wait until they send you a notice .
i could do that .
okay , uh , you let me go grocery shopping , and i buy laundry detergent , but it 's not the one with the easy-pour spout .
why would someone do that ? one might wonder .
someone 's left a glass on the coffee table . there 's no coaster . it 's a cold drink , it 's a hot day . little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood
stop it oh my god . it 's true who am i ?
monica ? you 're mom .

ree ree ree ree ree

uh huh uh huh oh my god okay okay , i 'll be there that was my agent . my agent has just gotten me a job in the new al pacino movie

oh , you got the whole night , huh ?
yeah , well , i only have twenty minutes until ethan , so , y 'know
ooh , do i sense a little bit of resentment ?
no , no resentment , believe me , it 's worth it . kay ? y 'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you 'll remember for the rest of your life ? well , every- single- second is like that with aurora and i 've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you
sure . oh , um , chandler ? y 'know , the-the old monica would-would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush but i 'm not gonna do that .

dammit , hire the girl okay , everybody ready ?
uh , listen , i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity .

and cut . hey , butt guy , what the hell are you doing ?
well , i 'm- i 'm showering .
no , that was clenching .
oh . well , the way i see it , the guy 's upset here , y 'know ? i mean , his wife 's dead , his brother 's missing i think his butt would be angry here .
i think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch . once again , rolling water working and action and cut . what was that ?
i was going for quiet desperation . but if you have to ask

god , i love these fingers
thank you .
no , actually i meant my fingers . look at em , look at how happy they are .
oh my god , i 'm late .
oh no nonononononnononono , don 't go
okay .
don 't go .
okay . oh no , i have to .
too bad , she 's leaving .
i 'm sorry . he 'll be waiting for me .
well , i thought- i thought you talked to rick .
it 's not rick .
what , ethan ? he got to spend the whole day with you
no , it 's-it 's andrew .
i know there 'll be many moments in the years to come when i 'll regret asking the following question , but- and andrew is ?
he 's new .
oh , so what you 're saying is you 're not completely fulfilled by rick , ethan and myself ?
no , that 's not exactly what i was
well , y 'know , most women would kill for three guys like us .
so what do you want ?
you .
you have me
nono , just you .
whaddyou mean ?
lose the other guys .
like , all of them ?
c 'mon , we 're great together , why not ?
why can 't we just have what we have now ? why can 't we just talk , and laugh , and make love , without feeling obligated to one another and up until tonight i thought that 's what you wanted too .
well , y 'know , part of me wants that , but it 's like i 'm two guys , y 'know ? i mean , one guy 's going shut up this is great but there 's this other guy . actually it 's the same guy that wells up every time that grinch 's heart grows three sizes
so which one of the two guys will you listen to ?
i don 't know , i-i have to listen to both of them , they don 't exactly let each other finish
which one ?
the second guy .
well , call me if you change your mind .

sorry , the first guy runs the lips .

look at it this way you dumped her . right ? i mean , this woman was unbelievably sexy , and beautiful , intelligent , unattainable tell me why you did this again ?

hey
hey , waitwait , aren 't you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie ?
nope .
no ? what happened , big guy ?
big guy ?
it felt like a big guy moment .
i got fired .
oh
yeah , they said i acted too much with it . i told everybody about this now everybody 's gonna go to the theatre , expecting to see me , and
oh , joey , you know what , no-one is gonna be able to tell .
my mom will .
something so sweet and disturbing about that .
y 'know , i 've done nothing but crappy plays for six years . and i finally get my shot , and i blow it
maybe this wasn 't your shot .
yeah , i mean i think when it 's your shot , y 'know , you-you know it 's your shot . did it feel like your shot ?
hard to tell , i was naked .
no , i don 't think this was your shot . i mean , i don 't even think you just get one shot . i really believe big things are gonna happen for you , i do you 've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go i
yeah ? that 's so nice

i 'm sorry , joey . i 'm gonna go to bed , guys .
night .
uh , mon , you-you gonna leave your shoes out here ?
uh-huh
really ? just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner ?
doesn 't matter , i 'll get em tomorrow . or not . whenever .
she is a kook .

if it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes . no . don 't do this . this is stupid i don 't have to prove anything , i 'm gonna go get them but then everyone will know . unless i get them , and then wake up really early and put them back

pheebs , what about you ?
oh milwaukee .
um ross ?
disneyland , 1989 , it 's a small world after all .

oh , rachel .
oh come on , i already went .
you did not go
come on .
oh , alright . the weirdest place would have to be oh , the foot of the bed .
step back .
we have a winner

i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion , you know , where you have to have somebody right there , in the middle of a theme park .
well , it was the only thing to do there that didn 't have a line .
there , well , see ? barry wouldn 't even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
come on .
no , he said we were holding up the people behind us .
and you didn 't marry him because ?
i mean , do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of
probably . but you know , i 'll tell you something . passion is way overrated .
yeah right .
it is . eventually , it kind of burns out . but hopefully , what you 're left with is trust , and security , and well , in the case of my ex-wife , lesbianism . so , you know , for all of those people who miss out on that passion thing , there 's all that other
ok .
but , um i don 't think that 's going to be you .
you don 't .
uh-uh . see , i see big passion in your future .
really ?
mmmm .
you do ?
i do .
oh ross , you 're so great .

it 's never gonna happen .
what ?
you and rachel .
what ? why not ?
because you waited too long to make your move , and now you 're in the friend zone .
no , no , no . i 'm not in the zone .
ross , you 're mayor of the zone .
i 'm taking my time , alright ? i 'm laying the groundwork . yeah . i mean , every day i get just a little bit closer to
priesthood look ross , i 'm telling you , she has no idea what you 're thinking . if you don 't ask her out soon you 're going to end up stuck in the zone forever .
i will , i will . see , i 'm waiting for the right moment . what ? what , now ?
yeeeeaaaahhh what 's messing you up ? the wine ? the candles ? the moonlight ? you 've just got to go up to her and say , rachel , i think that
shhhh
what are you shushing ?
we 're shushing because we 're trying to hear something . listen . don 't you hear that ?
ahhhh
see ?
huh .

would you like some gum ?
um , is it sugarless ?
sorry , it 's not .
oh , then no thanks . what the hell was that ? mental note if jill goodacre offers you gum , you take it . if she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it .

new york city has no power , and the milk is getting sour . but to me it is not scary , cause i stay away from dairy la la la , la la , la la
ok , here goes .
are you going to do it ?
i 'm going to do it .
do you want any help ?
you come out there , you 're a dead man .
good luck , man .

yuh-huh i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo . i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in . looks like i was second to last .

hmmm this is so nice .
ok , i have a question . well , actually , it 's not so much a question as more of a general wondering ment .

excuse me ? you don 't think i could get a brian ? because i could get a brian . believe you me . i 'm really not .

this one ?
no .
i have shown you everything we have . unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit , go with the burgundy .

you 're right . we 'll go with the burgundy .
oh a fine choice . i 'm coming out .
wait we need shoes

okay . um , how about these ?
that 's really a day shoe .
and where she 's going everyone else 'll be dressier ?

pheebs , could you maybe hand me a cracker ?
your grandmother would have hated this .

no , i 'd be hearing about why didn 't i get the honey-glazed ham ? , i didn 't spend enough on flowers , and if i spent more she 'd be saying why are you wasting your money ? i don 't need flowers , i 'm dead .
that sounds like nana .
do you know what it 's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say ?
i can imagine .
i 'm telling you , it 's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive , life-affirming person that she is .
that is a wonder . so tell me something , mom . if you had to do it all over again , i mean , if she was here right now , would you tell her ?
tell her what ?
how she drove you crazy , picking on every little detail , like your hair for example .
i 'm not sure i know what you 're getting at .
do you think things would have been better if you 'd just told her the truth ?
no . i think some things are better left unsaid . i think it 's nicer when people just get along .
huh .
more wine , dear ?
oh , i think so .
those earrings look really lovely on you .
thank you . they 're yours .
actually they were nana 's .

terry , i , i , i know that i haven 't worked here very long , but i was wondering , do you think it would be possible if i got a $ 100 advance in my salary ?
an advance ?
it 's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family . see , every year we go skiing in vail , and normally my father pays for my ticket , but i sort of started the whole independence thing , you know , which is actually why i took this job .
rachel , rachel , sweetheart . you 're a terrible , terrible waitress . really , really awful .

no , she 's at a faculty meeting .
oh , i uh , just came by to pick up my skull . well , not mine , but susan come in .

yes , i 'm familiar with the concept . we can just look for it .
ok . wow , you guys sure have a lot of books about bein a lesbian .
well , you know , you have to take a course . otherwise , they don 't let you do it .
hey , hey , yertle the turtle . a classic .
actually , i 'm reading it to the baby .
the uh , the baby that hasn 't been born yet ? wouldn 't that mean you 're crazy ?
what , you don 't think they can hear sounds in there ?
you 're not serious , i mean , you really you really talk to it ?
yeah , all the time . i want the baby to know my voice .
do you uh , do you talk about me ?
yeah , yeah , all the time .
really ?
but um , we just refer to you as bobo the sperm guy .

look , if she 's talking to it , i just think that i should get some belly time too . not that i believe any of this .
oh , i believe it . i think the baby can totally hear everything . i can show you . look , this will seem a little weird , but you put your head inside this turkey , and then we 'll all talk , and you 'll hear everything we say .
i 'd just like to say that i 'm totally behind this experiment . in fact , i 'd very much like to butter your head .

hey , rach , did you make your money ?

ok , mom never hit .

ok , all done .
what , phoebe , did you whip the potatoes ? ross needs lumps
oh , i 'm sorry , oh , i just , i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .

ross he 's playing with my spatulas again
okay , look , he 's not gonna hurt them , right ?
do you always have to bring him here ?
i didn 't wanna leave him alone . alright ? we- we had our first fight this morning . i think it has to do with my working late . i said some things that i didn 't mean , and he- he threw some faeces
y 'know , if you 're gonna work late , i could look in on him for you .
oh , that 'd be great okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you 're there to see him , okay , and you 're not like doing it as a favour to me .
okay , but if he asks , i 'm not going to lie .

but , you can 't actually test this theory , because today 's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .
okay , alright , i have a question , then .
yuh .
um , were you planning on kissing me ever ?
uh , that 's definitely a , uh , valid question . and , uh , the answer would be yes . yes i was . but , see , i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment , because , well , cause it 's you .

right . but , see , the longer i waited , the more phenomenal the kiss had to be , and now we 've reached a place where it 's just gotta be one of those things where i just like sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it . and , uh , i 'm not
oh , david , i , i think you are a sweeping sorta fella . i mean , you 're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist 's body .

ok , ok , how about if we split it ?
what do you mean , like , buy it together ?
yeah
you think we 're ready for something like that ?
why not ?
well , it 's a pretty big commitment , i mean , what if one of us wants to move out ?
why , are you moving out ?
i 'm not moving out .
you 'd tell me if you were moving out right
yeah , yeah , it 's just that with my last roommate kip

we should get over there and see if she 's okay . just one second score game come on .
ah ooh well , looks like , uh , we kicked your butts .
no-no , she kicked our butts . you could be on the olympic standing-there team .
come on , two on one .
what are you still doing here ? she just broke up with the guy , it 's time for you to swoop in
what , now ?
yes , now is when you swoop you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there , the first guy rachel sees is you , she 's gotta know that you 're everything he 's not you 're like , like the anti-paolo
my catholic friend is right . she 's distraught . you 're there for her . you pick up the pieces , and then you usher in the age of ross

no , that 's cold , that 's cold , that 's

how 's it going ?
don 't stare . now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony , now there 's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving , , ok , that is either , how could you ? or , enormous breasts here he comes

paolo , i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say
oh , just look at her

hey .
hey .
you all right ?
ooh , i 've been better
come here . listen , you deserve so much better than him you know , i mean , you , you , you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you .

ooh hey honey , are you all right ?
oh
you ok ?
medium hmm any cookies left ?
yep
see , rach , uh , see , i don 't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer . i really don 't . i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .
no . i just need to be by myself for a while , you know ? i just got to figure out what i want
uh , no , no , see , because not not all guys are going to be a paolo .

okaaay , rock , hard place , me .
you 're so funny he 's really funny i wouldn 't wanna be there when when the laughter stops .
whoah whoah , back up there , sparky . what 'd you mean by that ?
oh , just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues . y 'know , that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance .
huh .
i mean hey i just met you , i don 't know you from adam . only child , right ? parents divorced before you hit puberty .
uhhuh , how did you know that ?
it 's textbook .

hey you guys . hey , you all know my dad , right ?
hey hey , mr. trib
hey , how long are you in the city ?
just for a coupla days . i got a job midtown . i figure i 'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry . i don 't know this one .
oh , this is my friend roger .
hi .
hey , hey . good to meet you , roger .
you too , sir .
what happened to the , uh , puppet guy ?
dad , dad .
oh , scuse me . so ross , uh , how 's the wife ? off there too , uh ? uh , chandler , quick , say something funny

gotta go . i miss you too , i love you , but it 's getting real late now
hey ma . listen , i made the appointment with dr. bazida , and excuse me ? did you know this isn 't ma ?

her name 's ronni . she 's a pet mortician .
sure . so how long you been
remember when you were a little kid , i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships ?
since then ?
no , it 's only been six years . i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you 'd know that i wasn 't always such a terrible guy . joe . y 'ever been in love ?
i d 'know .
then y 'haven 't . you 're burning your tomatoes .
you 're one to talk .
joe , your dad 's in love big time . and the worst part of it is , it 's with two different women .
oh man . please tell me one of em is ma .
of course , course one of em 's ma . what 's the matter with you .

it 's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life . he 's like actually some spy , working for the c.i.a. that 'd be cool this blows
i know , i mean , why can 't parents just stay parents ? why do they have to become people ? why do they have why can 't you stop staring at my breasts ?
what ? what ?
did you not get a good enough look the other day ?
alright , alright . we 're all adults here , there 's only one way to resolve this . since you saw her boobies , i think , uh , you 're gonna have to show her your peepee .
y 'know , i don 't see that happening ?
c 'mon , he 's right . tit for tat .
well i 'm not showing you my tat .

hello ?
it 's phoebe .
and rog .
c 'mon up .
oh , good . rog is here .
what 's the matter with rog ?
yeah .
oh , it 's nothing , it 's a little thing i hate that guy .
what , so he was a little analytical . that 's what he does , y 'know ? c 'mon , he 's not that bad .

y 'see , that 's where you 're wrong . why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian ?
i dunno . maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .
why ? why would i why ? why ? why ? why ?
i don 't know . maybe maybe low self-esteem , maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling , maybe you
wait-wait , go back to that sibling thing .
well , i don 't know . i mean , it 's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents .
that that 's ridiculous i don 't feel guilty for her failures
oh so you think i 'm a failure
isn 't he good ?
nonono , thatthat 's not what i was saying
y 'know , all these years , i thought you were on my side . but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they 'd keep liking you better
hey , i married a lesbian to make you look good

you 're right i mean you 're right it wasn 't just the weebles , but it was the weeble play palace , and and the weebles cruise ship . oh , which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .
that 's tough . tough stuff . c 'mon , pheebs , we 're gonna catch that movie , we gotta get going .

uh , joey 's having an embolism , but i 'd go for a nip , y 'know ?

i 've been thinking . y 'know , about how i 'm always seeing girls on top of girls
are they end to end , or tall like pancakes ?
y 'know what i mean , about how i 'm always going out with all these women . and i always figured , when the right one comes along , i 'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance , y 'know ? now i 'm looking at my dad , thinking
hey , you 're not him . you 're you . when they were all over you to go into your father 's pipe-fitting business , did you cave ?
no .
no . you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business . now that wasn 't easy , but you did it and i 'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along , you will have the courage and the guts to say no thanks , i 'm married .

how 's it going ?
good . oh oh roger 's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys .

so what 's going on ?

i dunno , there 's just something about
basically we just feel that he 's
we hate that guy .
yeah . hate him .
we 're sorry , pheebs , we 're sorry .
uh-huh . okay . okay , don 't you think , maybe , though , it 's just that he 's so perceptive that it freaks you out ?
no , we hate him .
we 're sorry .

ma what 're you doing here ?
i came to give you this and this .
oww big ring
why did you have to fill your father 's head with all that garbage about making things right ? things were fine the way they were there 's chicken in there , put it away . for god 's sake , joey , really .
hold on , you-you knew ?
of course i knew what did you think ? your father is no james bond . you should 've heard some of his cover stories . i 'm sleeping over at my accountant 's , i mean , what is that ? please
so then how could you i mean , how could you ?
do you remember how your father used to be ? always yelling , always yelling nothing made him happy , nothing made him happy , not that wood shop , not those stupid little ships in the bottle , nothing . now he 's happy i mean , it 's nice , he has a hobby .
ma , i don 't mean to be disrespectful , but what the hell are you talking about ? i mean , what about you ?
me ? i 'm fine . look , honey , in an ideal world , there 'd be no her , and your father would look like sting . and i 'll tell you something else . ever since that poodle-stuffer came along , he 's been so ashamed of himself that he 's been more attentive , he 's
i 'm happy for you ?
well don 't be , because now everything 's screwed up . i just want it the way it was .
ma , i 'm sorry . i just did what i thought you 'd want .
i know you did , cookie . oh , i know you did . so tell me . did you see her ?
yeah . you 're ten times prettier than she is .
that 's sweet . could i take her ?
with this ring ? no contest .

what 's wrong , sweetie ?
nothing , nothing .
aaaah , what 's wrong , c 'mon .
it 's , i mean , it 's nothing , i 'm fine . it 's my friends . they-they have a liking problem with you . in that , um , they don 't .
oh . they don 't .
but they don 't see all the wonderfulness that i see . they don 't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff . they just think you 're a little
what ?
intense and creepy .
oh .
but i don 't . me , phoebe .
well , i 'm not i 'm not at all surprised they feel that way .
you 're not ? see , that 's why you 're so great
actually it 's , it 's quite , y 'know , typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic . y 'know , this kind of co-dependant , emotionally stunted , sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which , i 'm sorry , might as well have nipples on them , and

so you talked to your dad , huh .
yeah . he 's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted , she 's gonna keep pretending she doesn 't know even though she does , and my little sister tina can 't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today .
wow .
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .
so joey , you okay ?
yeah , i guess . it 's just parents , after a certain point , you gotta let go . even if you know better , you 've gotta let them make their own mistakes .
just think , in a couple of years we get to turn into them .
if i turn into my parents , i 'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys , or i 'll end up like my mom .
hey .
hey , pheebs .
how 's it going ?
oh , okay , except i broke up with roger .
awww .
yeah , right .
aaawwwwww
what happened ?
i don 't know , i mean , he 's a good person , and he can be really sweet , and in some ways i think he is so right for me , it 's just i hate that guy

hey , joey . what 's going on ?
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express . next stop rachel green .
joey what the hell were you doing ?
sorry . wrong boobies .

hello , joey .

oh hello , dear .

yeah , you 're gonna go up to her and say , here 's your egg back , i 'm returning your egg .
i think it 's winning .
i think it 's insane .
she 'll love it . go with the egg , my friend .

think it 'll work ?
no , it 's suicide . the man 's got an egg .

you can not do this .
do what , do what ?
roger wants to take her out tomorrow night .
no phoebes don 't you remember why you dumped the guy ?
'cause he was creepy , and mean , and a little frightening alright , still , it 's nice to have a date on valentine 's day
but phoebe , you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year . i know i do .
well , what are you guys doing tomorrow night ?
actually , tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes .
oh , uh , listen , about tonight
no , no , no , don 't you dare bail on me . the only reason she 's goin out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend .
yes , i know , but her friend sounds like such a
pathetic mess ? i know , but  come on , man , she 's needy , she 's vulnerable . i 'm thinkin , cha-ching thanks . look , you have not been out with a woman since janice . you 're doin this .
hi . she said yes .
yes way to go , man still got the egg , huh ?

how do i look ?
oh , uh , i don 't care . ok , now , remember , no trading . you get the pretty one , i get the mess .
hi , joey . well well , look what you brought . very nice .
and what did you bring ?
she 's checking the coats . joey , i 'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands . will you get me a white zinfandel , and a glass of red for janice .

calm down ? calm down ? you set me up with the woman that i 've dumped twice in the last five months
can you stop yellin ? you 're makin me nervous , and i can 't go when i 'm nervous .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , you 're right . come on , do it , do it , go , come on

ok , ok , roger was creepy , but he was nothing compared to pete carney .
which one was pete carney ?
pete the weeper ? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex . was it good for you ?
yeah , well , i 'll take a little crying any day over howard-the- i-win -guy . i win i win i went out with the guy for two months  i didn 't get to win once .
how did we end up with these jerks ? we 're good people
i don 't know . maybe we 're some kinda magnets .
i know i am . that 's why i can 't wear a digital watch .
there 's more beer , right ?
oh you know my friend abby who shaves her head ? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle , you can do like a cleansing ritual .
pheebes , this woman is voluntarily bald .
yeah . so , we can do it tomorrow night , you guys . it 's valentine 's day . it 's perfect .
ok , well , what kind of ritual ?
ok . we can , um , we can burn the stuff they gave us .
or ?
or or we can chant and dance around naked , you know , with sticks .
burning 's good .
burning 's good . yeah , i got stuff to burn .

you know , ever since i was little , i 've been able to pick up quarters with my toes .
good for you . uh , quarters or rolls of quarters ?
by the way , chandler . i cut you out of all my pictures . so if you want , i have a bag with just your heads .
that 's ok .
oh , are you sure ? really ? because you know , you could make little puppets out of them , and you could use them in your theater of cruelty .

we can 't do that .
what ? what can 't you do ?
uh , can i talk to you for a second , over there ?

uh , we might be leaving now .

rachel .
barry ?
i can 't . i can 't do it , i can 't marry mindy . i think i 'm still in love with you .

nope .
that 's because i 'm in front of them .
eh . i thought that was an alp .
well , high school was not my favourite time .
i dunno , i loved high school . y 'know ? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex .
yeah , well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys . any sex i had would 've involved a major lifestyle choice .
gosh , doesn 't it seem like a million years ago ?
oh . oooh ooh ooh ooh my butt cheek is waking up oooh ooh

how could someone get a hold of your credit card number ?
i have no idea . but look how much they spent
monica , would you calm down ? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought .
i know . it 's just such reckless spending .
i think when someone steals your credit card , they 've kind of already thrown caution to the wind .
wow , what a geek . they spent $ 69.95 on a wonder mop .
that 's me .
oh the yuk ross , he 's doing it again
marcel , stop humping the lamp stop humping now marcel , come back- come here , marcel-
oh no , not in my room i 'll get him .

what ? it 's , it 's just a phase .
well , that 's what we said about joey
would you all relax ? it 's not that big a deal .
stop it marcel bad monkey
what ?
let 's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious .

oh , monica . you are not still going over that thing .
this woman 's living my life .
what ?
she 's living my life , and she 's doing it better than me look at this , look . she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see . she , she buys clothes from stores that i 'm intimidated by the sales people . she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies .
you 're not an artist .
yeah , well i might be if i had the supplies i mean , i could do all this stuff . only i don 't .
oh , monica , c 'mon , you do cool things .
oh really ? okay , let 's compare , shall we .
oh , it 's so late for shall we
do i go horseback riding in the park ? do i take classes at the new school ?
nooo
this is so unfair she 's got everything i want , and she doesn 't have my mother .

how about joey pepponi ?
no , still too ethnic . my agent thinks i should have a name that 's more neutral .
joey switzerland ?

plus , y 'know , i think it should be joe . y 'know , joey makes me sound like i 'm , i dunno , this big . which i 'm not .
joe joe joe stalin ?
stalin stalin do i know that name ? it sounds familiar .
well , it does not ring a bell with me
joe stalin . y 'know , that 's pretty good .

this is madness . it 's madness , i tell you , for the love of god , monica , don 't do it thank you .

what d 'you think ?
lotsa things .

which one do you think she is ?

may i help you ?
oh , no thanks , we 're just here to observe .

i think she means you dance
okay , d 'y'see anybody you think could be me ?

monana ?
yeah . it 's dutch .
you 're kidding i-i spent three years in amsterdam .
um , pennsylvania dutch .
and we 're dancing . a-five , six , seven , eight

hi .
hey .
where 've you been ?
at the vet .
she 's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones , is she ?
she says marcel 's humping thing 's not a phase . apparently he 's reached sexual maturity .
hey he beat ya .
she says as time goes on , he 's gonna start getting agressive and violent .
so what does this mean ?
i 'm gonna have to give him up .

i can 't believe it , ross . this sucks
i don 't get it , i mean , you just got him . how can he be an adult already ?
i know . i know . i mean , one day , he 's this little thing , and before you know it , he 's this little thing i can 't get off my leg .
isn 't there any way you can keep him ?
no , no . the vet says unless he 's in a place where he has regular access to some monkey lovin , he 's just gonna get vicious . i 've just gotta get him into a zoo .
how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
i know that one no , that 's popes into a volkswagen .
well , we 're applying to a lot of them . naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos , y 'know , like , uh , san diego right ? but that might just be a pipe dream , because , y 'know , he 's out of state . uh , my vet ,
yeah , but that 's like two blocks away from the beach . i mean , it 's a total party zoo .

hey . we found her , we found the girl .
what ?
did you call the cops ?
nope . we took her to lunch .
ah . your own brand of vigilante justice .
what ? are you insane ? this woman stole from you . she stole . she 's a stealer .
y 'know what ? after you 're with this woman for like ten minutes , you forget all that . i mean , she is this astounding person , with this , with this amazing spirit .
yeah , which she probably stole from some cheerleader .
take off their hats
popes in a volkswagen i love that joke .

no way . no way did you do this .
monana was very brave .
it was so wild . we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen . only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor
so once they caught on to the fact that we 're , y 'know , short and have breasts
they threw us out i was thrown out of a hotel me
go monana well , you ladies are not the only ones living the dream . i get to go pour coffee for people i don 't know . don 't wait up .
oh , by the way , tomorrow we 're auditioning for a broadway show .
'scuse me ?
there 's an open call for cats . i 'm thinking we go down there , sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves . whaddya say ?
nononononono . think who you 're dealing with here . i mean , i 'm not like you . i-i can 't even stand in front of a tap class .
well , that 's just probably cause of your amish background .
what ?
well , you 're pennsylvania dutch , right ?
right . till i bought a blow dryer , then i was shunned .
i-i used to be just like you . and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life . did you ever see dead poets society ?
uh-huh .
i thought that movie was so incredibly boring . i mean , that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can 't be in the play ? what was that ? it 's like , kid , wait a year , leave home , do some community theatre . i walked out of there and i
wow . then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire .

oh god . we didn 't get into scranton . that was like our safety zoo . they take like dogs and cows . see ? i don 't know who this is harder on , me or him .
i 'd say that chair 's taking the brunt .
marcel marcel marcel , no good boy . see , how can nobody want him ?
oh , somebody will .
you know there already is a joseph stalin ?
you 're kidding .
apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people . you 'd think you would 've known that
y 'know , you 'd think i would 've .
phoebe . whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be ?
flame boy .

where exactly is your zoo ?
well , it 's technically not a zoo per se , it 's more of an interactive wildlife experience . let me ask you some questions about , is it , uh , marcel ?
yes .
does he , uh , fight with other animals ?
no-no , he 's , he 's very docile .
even if he were cornered ?
well i , i don 't know . why ?
uh , how is he at handling small objects ?
he can hold a banana , if that 's whatcha mean
how about a hammer , or a small blade ?
why- why- why would he need a blade ?
well , if he 's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns , you 've got to give the little guy something . otherwise it 's just cruel .

he- he- he got in , he- he got in to san diego .
we , we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing
he 's in .
he 's in oh , did you hear that , marcel ? san diego . san diego
you 're making a big mistake here . i mean , san diego 's all well and good , but if you give him to me , i 'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains .

yo- hooo
where the hell 've you been ?
monica and i just crashed an embassy party .

i just can 't believe you 're in here . i mean , what am i gonna do without you ? who 's gonna crash the embassy parties with me ? who 's gonna take me to the big apple circus ?
monica , i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women , and you 're worried about who 's gonna take you to the big apple circus ?
well , not worried , just wondering .
there 's nothing to wonder about , monica . you 're gonna go back to being exactly who you were , because that 's who you are .
not necessarily
yes necessarily i mean , i dunno what it is , maybe it 's the amish thing .
um , i 'm not actually amish .

you by the door . in or out ?
in .
you in the back , you 're getting it all wrong
yeah , but at least i 'm doing it

mazel tov

i don 't know , could be an hour , could be three , but relax , she 's doing great . so , uh , tell me , are you currently involved with anyone ?
no , no , not at the moment , no , i 'm not . are you ?
no , it 's hard enough to get women to go out with me .
right , yeah , i 've heard that about cute doctors .
no , no , really . i suppose it 's because i spend so much time , you know , where i do .
oh .
i try not to let my work affect my personal life , but it 's hard , when you do what i do . it 's like uh well , for instance , what do you do ?
i 'm a waitress .
ok , all right , well aren 't there times when you come home at the end of the day , and you 're just like , if i see one more cup of coffee
yeah . gotcha .
i 'm gonna go check up on your friend .
ok . that 's fine .

so how did you know i was even here ?
your mom called me . so is this her ?

the woman i love is having a baby today . i 've been waiting for this just as much as you have .
no no no , believe me . no one has been waiting for this as much as i have , ok ? and you know what the funny thing is ? when this day is over , you get to go home with the baby , ok ? where does that leave me ?
you get to be the baby 's father . everyone knows who you are . who am i ? there 's mother 's day , there 's father 's day , there 's no lesbian lover day .
every day is lesbian lover day .
this is so great .
you wanna explain that ?
i mean , well , cause when i was growing up , you know my dad left , and my mother died , and my stepfather went to jail , so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one . and here 's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it

where are they ?
i 'm sure they 'll be here soon .
yeah , honey , they wouldn 't miss this .

you are really frightening me .

this one 's from joey feels like a book . thinks it 's a book feels like a book . and it 's a book
oh , it 's dr. seuss
that book got me through some tough times .
there is a little child inside this man
yes , the doctors say if they remove it , he 'll die .

who 's this from ?
oh , that 's ross 's .
oh oh my god . he remembered .
remembered what ?
it was like months ago . we were walking by this antique store , and i saw this pin in the window , and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl . oh i can 't believe he remembered
well , sure , but can you play it on a plane ?
oh , it 's so pretty . this must have cost him a fortune .
i can 't believe he did this .
come on , ross ? remember back in college , when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck ?

what did you just say ?
ahem um crystal duck .
no , no , no the , um , the love part ?
f-hah flennin
oh my god .
oh , no-no-no-no-no
that 's good , just keep rubbing your head . that 'll turn back time .

i know . this is really , really huge .
no it 's not . it 's small . it 's tiny . it 's petite . it 's wee .
nuh-uh . i don 't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again .
ok , is there a mute button on this woman ?
i think this is so great i mean , you and ross d-did you have any idea ?
no none i mean , my first night in the city , he mentioned something about asking me out , but nothing ever happened , so i just w-well , what else did he say ? i mean , does he , like , want to go out with me ?
well , given that he 's desperately in love with you , he probably wouldn 't mind getting a cup of coffee or something .
ross ? all this time ? well , i 've got to talk to him .
h-he 's in china
the country .
no , no , wait . his flight doesn 't leave for another forty-five more minutes .

rachel , what 're you gonna say to him ?
i-i-i don 't know .
well then maybe you shouldn 't go .
he 's right , cause if you 're just gonna , like , break his heart , that 's the kind of thing that can wait .

i don 't know . i don 't know i thought about it all the way there , and i thought about it all the way back and , uh , oh , you guys , y 'know , it 's ross . y 'know what i mean ? i mean , it 's ross .
sure .
i don 't know , i mean , this is just my initial gut feeling but i 'm thinking oh , i 'm thinking it 'd be really great .
oh my god , me too oh oh , we 'd be like friends-in-law y 'know what the best part is ? the best part is that you already know everything about him i mean , it 's like starting on the fifteenth date
yeah , but , y 'know , it 's it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .
another good point .
no , i mean , i mean , when you 're at the fifteenth date , y 'know , you 're already in a very relationshippy place . y 'know , it 's you 're committed .
huh ?
well , i mean , then what happens if it doesn 't work out ?
why isn 't it working out ?
i don 't know sometimes it doesn 't .
is he not cute enough for you ?
no
does he not make enough money ?
no , i 'm just
maybe there 's someone else .
wha
is there ? is there someone else ?
no there is there is noone else
then why the hell are you dumping my brother ? ?

hey , big
shhhh
spender .
she 's still asleep .
so how 'd it go ?
oh , it was amazing . you know how you always think you 're great in bed ?
the fact that you 'd even ask that question shows how little you know me .
well , it 's like , last night , i couldn 't do the thing that usually makes me great . so i had to do all this other stuff . and the response i got man , oh man , it was like a ticker tape parade
yes , i know , as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route .
it was amazing and not just for her uh-uh . for me , too . it 's like , all of a sudden , i 'm blind . but all my other senses are heightened , y 'know ? it 's like i was able to appreciate it on another level .
i didn 't know you had another level .
i know neither did i

hey , great skirt birthday present ?
yeah .
oh , from who ?
from you . i exchanged the blouse you got me .
well , it 's the thought . hey , doesn 't ross 's flight get in in a couple hours ? at gate 27-b ?
uh , yeah . uh , monica , y 'know , honey , i 've been thinking about it and i 've decided this  this whole ross thing , it 's just not a good idea .
oh , why ?
because , i feel like i wouldn 't just be going out with him . i would be going out with all of you . oh , and there would just be all this pressure , and i don 't wanna
no , no , no , no , no , no pressure , no pressure
monica , nothing has even happened yet , and you 're already so
i am not so ok , i was a teensy bit weird at first , but i 'll be good . i promise .

who is it ?
it 's me , carl .
c 'mon up .
behind my brother 's back ? is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won 't be hearing from me .

seven hundred bucks
alright , you did it do we have any fruit ?
man , hell of a two weeks , huh ? y 'know what , though ? i really feel like i learned something .
really ? so , you 're gonna stick with this it 's all for her thing ?
what , are you crazy ? when a blind man gets his sight back , does he walk around like this ?

i 'm just sayin , if i see one more picture of ed begley , jr. in that stupid electric car , i 'm gonna shoot myself i mean , don 't get me wrong i 'm not against environmental issues per se it 's just that guy

i can 't believe you 'd rather go out with him than me .
would you excuse me , please ? i 'm trying to have a date here .
fine , just stop thinking about me .

can 't do it , can you ?
so i 'm thinking about you . so what ?
i don 't get it . what do you see in this guy , anyway ?
well he happens to be a very nice guy
i mean , come on , buddy , get a real car
rachel , come on . give us a chance .
ross , it 's too hard .
no , no , no why , because it might get weird for everyone else ? who cares about them . this is about us . look , i-i 've been in love with you since , like , the ninth grade .
ross , you 're like my best friend .
i know .
if we broke up , and i lost you
whoa , whoa , whoa . what makes you think we 're gonna break up ?
well , have you been involved with someone where you haven 't broken up ?
no . but it only has to happen once . look , you and i both know we are perfect for each other , right ? i mean so , the only question is are you attracted to me ?
i don 't know i mean , i 've never looked at you that way before .
well , start looking .

wow .
exactly and you just know i 'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic
right you 're right
heh y 'know ?

ok , so this is pretty much what 's happened so far . ross was in love with rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and italian guys . finally chandler was like forget about her but when ross

well , ross and i were in grad school together .
but we haven 't seen each other since then . well i land in china , guess who 's in charge of the dig .
julie julie , isn 't that great ? i mean , isn 't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch , spit-on-your-neck fantastic ?
it 's an expression .
well , we just wanted to say a quick hi , and then we 're gonna go see the baby .
and then we 've gotta get some sleep .

then , no .

so what the hell happened to you in china ? i mean , when last we left you , you were totally in love with , you know .
i know , i know i was , but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it 's never gonna happen , move on . you know whose voice that was ?
god ?
it was you , pal .
well , maybe it was god , doing me .
look , you were right . she looks at me and sees a friend , that 's all . but then i met julie , and i don 't know , we 're havin a great time . and i have to say , i never would 've gone for it with her if it hadn 't been for you
well , you owe me one , big guy .
here 's your lemonade .
i didn 't order lemonade .
oh . well then , you better go take that back because they 're gonna charge you for that .
but
go-go-go-go , come on so uh , what did you find out ?
he said he said , he said that they 're having a great time . i 'm sorry . but , the silver lining , if you wanna see it , is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever .
how is that the silver lining ?
you have to really wanna see it .

ironically , these are the guys who were picked last in gym .

pheebes , you know what i 'm thinking ?
oh , ok . how , it 's been so long since you 've had sex , you 're wondering if they 've changed it ?
no , although now that 's what i 'm thinking .
all right , so what were you thinking ?
well , i was thinking , that you gave the guys such great haircuts , i thought , maybe you 'd like to do mine ?
ohh no .
why not ?
because , i 'm just , i 'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak .
no you 're not .
i know i 'm not , but you are , and i was trying to spare your feelings .

hello ? oh , hi . yeah , hold on a second . ross , it 's julie , for you .

bon giorno tutti
ewww

ok , paulo , why don 't you just go get dressed , and then you be on your way , ok , bye-bye .
rachel , how did this happen ?
i don 't know , i just kinda ran into him last night .
where ?
at his apartment . is this juice ?
whoa , whoa . and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe ?
oh god , i know i 'm a pathetic loser .
honey , you 're not pathetic , you 're sad .
people do stupid things when they 're upset .
my god , if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn 't , but this is about your horrible mistake .

hi
hi . sorry we 're late but we were  well , there was touching .
hey , hey ross .
hey , paulo . what are you doing here ?
i do raquel .
so , uh , he 's back .
yeah , he 's back . is that a problem ?
no , not a problem .
good i 'm glad it 's not a problem .
ok , you 're gonna have to not touch my ass .
well , in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension , i 've got pants that need to be altered .
hey , chandler , when you see frankie , tell him joey tribbiani says hello . he 'll know what it means .
are you sure he 's gonna be able to crack that code ?
you know it 's funny , the last time paulo was here , my hair was so much shorter and cuter .
all right . ok , but , but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it .
i promise .
all right . now some of you are gonna get cut , and some of you aren 't . but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing .

all right , that 's it , i quit .
what ? i didn 't say anything .
yeah , but this isn 't the face of a person who trusts a person . ok , this is the face of a person who , you know , doesn 't trust a person .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , phoebe . it 's just a little shorter than what we had discussed .
would you relax ? i know what i am doing . this is how he wears it .
how who wears it ?
demi moore .
demi moore is not a he .
well , he was a he in arthur , and in ten .
that 's dudley moore . i said i wanted it like demi moore .
oh . oh
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . which one 's demi moore ?
she 's the act ress that was in disclosure , indecent proposal , ghost
oh , she 's got gorgeous hair .
i know

how long do you want the cuffs ?
at least as long as i have the pants .

i just got that . ok , now we 'll do your inseam .

how is she ?
it 's too soon to tell . she 's resting , which is a good sign .
how 's the hair ?
i 'm not gonna lie to you , ross , it doesn 't look good . i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling .
can we see her ?
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her . ross , why don 't you come on in .
yeah .

how 're you doing ?
i 'm okay .
ooh , that bad , huh ?
what ?
look , i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable . it 's one of my gifts .
when i saw him get off that plane with her , i really thought i hit rock bottom . but today , it 's like there 's rock bottom , 50 feet of crap , then me .
you gotta tell ross how you feel .
come on . how can i just tell him ? what about julie ?
what about her ? they 've only been going out for two weeks . ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .
i don 't know , i don 't know .
look , rach , rach i 've been with my share of women . in fact , i 've been with like a lot of people 's share of women . the point is , i 've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you .
yo , paisan can i talk to you for a sec ? your tailor is a very bad man
frankie ? what 're you talking about ?
hey , what 's goin on ?
joey 's tailor took advantage of me .
what ?
no way . i 've been going to the guy for 12 years .
oh come on he said he was going to do my inseam , and he ran his hand up my leg , and then , there was definite
what ?
cupping .
that 's how they do pants first they go up one side , they move it over , then they go up the other side , they move it back , and then they do the rear . what ? ross , ross , would you tell him ? isn 't that how they measure pants ?
yes , yes it is . in prison whatsa matter with you ?
what ? that 's not ? oh my god .

even mary tyler moore would 've been better .
i like it . i do , i think it 's a ten .
thank you . my hair is very amused .
come on , monica , things could be worse . you could get caught between the moon and new york city . i know it 's crazy , but it 's true .
thank you .
well , i gotta go . bye . bye , rach .
wait , are you leaving ?
yeah , that 's kinda what i meant by bye
well , can i talk to you for a sec ?
okay .
hey , when the doctor does that hernia test
that 's ok .

what 's goin on ?
well , first of all , paulo and i are not back together . it was just a stupid thing i did , and if i could go back in time and do it again , well , i wouldn 't . um , second of all , what ?
ok . well , before i say anything , i just need to know , is this one of those things where you break up with a guy , and then i tell you what i think , and then the next day you get back together with the guy , and i look like a complete idiot ?
no . no-no-no-no .
well , then , i think , i think the guy is scum . i hate him . i mean i actually  i-i physically hate him . i always have . you are way too good to be with a guy like that .
really ?
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you , and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing , and adorable , and sexy you are , you know ? someone who wakes up every morning thinking oh my god , i 'm with rachel . you know , someone who makes you feel good , the way i
no , i think that was the whole all .
okay . okay . okay .

i swear to god , dad . that 's not how they measure pants .

i was thinking of doing it a little shorter , you know , like andie mcdowell 's new haircut ?
oh yeah oh , i can do that .
really ?
you wanna do it right now ?
great
ok , i just wanna be really sure this time . andie mcdowell 's the girl from four weddings and a funeral , right ?
no . no no no no no . that 's rodney mcdowell . andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes .
oh , yeah . ok , thank you .
you 're welcome .

ok , these were unbelievably expensive , and i know he 's gonna grow out of them in like , 20 minutes , but i couldn 't resist .
oh , look at these hey , ben . just do it . oh my god , oh , ok , was that too much pressure for him ?
oh , is he hungry already ?

ben , dinner
thanks aunt pheebs . hey , you didn 't microwave that , did you , because it 's breast milk , and you 're not supposed to do that .
duh , i think i know how to heat breast milk . ok .
what did you just do ?
i licked my arm , what ?
it 's breast milk .
so ?
phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
what is the big deal ?
what did you just do ?
ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
you won 't even taste it ?
no
not even if you just pretend that it 's milk ?
not even if carol 's breast had a picture of a missing child on it .

hey , where is everybody ?
they took ben to the park . where 've you been ?
just out . had some lunch , just me , little quality time with me . thanks for your jacket .
oh , no problem . you can borrow it , by the way . here are your keys , hon .
okay .
mon , if uh you were at lunch alone , how come it cost you uh 53 dollars ?
you know what probably happened ? someone musta stolen my credit card .
and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?
that is an excellent excellent question . that is excellent .
monica , what is with you ? who 'd you have lunch with ?
judy .
who ?
julie .
what ?
jody
you were with julie ?
look , when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother 's girlfriend . and then , one thing led to another and , before i knew it , we were shopping .
oh . oh my god .
honey , wait . we only did it once . it didn 't mean anything to me .
yeah , right . sure
really , rachel , i was thinking of you the whole time . look , i 'm sorry , all right . i never meant for you to find out
oh , please , you wanted to get caught .
that is not true
oh , so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?
ok , monica . i just have to know one thing . did you go with her to bloomingdale 's ? oh ok , ok , ok , i just really , uh , i just really need to not be with you right now .

hi , who 's this ? hi , joanne . is rachel working ? it 's monica . yes , i know i did a horrible thing . joanne , it 's not as simple as all that , ok ? no , i don 't care what steve thinks . hi , steve .

hey
how did we do ?
oh , i tasted ben 's milk , and ross freaked out .
i did not freak out .
why 'd you freak out ?
because it 's breast milk . it 's gross .
my breast milk is gross ?
this should be fun .
no , no , carol . there 's nothing wrong with it . i just , i just don 't think breast milk is for adults .
of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike .
ross , you 're being silly . i 've tried it , it 's no big deal . just taste it .
that would be no .
come on . it doesn 't taste bad .
yeah , it 's kinda sweet , sorta like , uh
cantaloupe juice .
exactly .
you 've tasted it ? you 've tasted it .
uh huh .
oh , you 've tasted it .
you can keep saying it , but it won 't stop being true .
gimme the bottle . gimme the towel .

howdy .
gimme a box a juice . well , they switched me over to hombre .
well , maybe it 's because of the way you 're dressed .
or maybe it 's because this guy 's doing so good they wanna put more people on it . you should see this guy , chandler , he goes through two bottles a day .
what do you care ? you 're an actor . this is your day job . this isn 't supposed to mean anything to you .
i know , but , i was the best , you know ? i liked being the best . i don 't know . maybe i should just get outta the game . they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .
all right , say you do that . you know sooner or later somebody 's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar . and then where 're you gonna run ?
yeah i guess you 're right .
you 're damn right i 'm right . i say you show this guy what you 're made of . i say you stand your ground . i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie .
i 'm gonna do it .
all right . now go see miss kitty and she 'll fix you up with a nice hooker .

i don 't know what else to say .
well that works out good , because i 'm not listening .
i feel terrible , i really do .
oh , i 'm sorry , did my back hurt your knife ?
rachel , say that i 'm friends with her , we spend some time together . is that so terrible ?
yes .
it 's that terrible ?
yes . monica , you don 't get it . it 's bad enough that she 's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with , but now , she 's actually , but now she 's actually stealing you .
me ? what are you talking about ? nobody could steal me from you . i mean , just because i 'm friends with her doesn 't make me any less friends with you . i mean , you 're my we 're , we 're oh , i love you .

this is unbelievable phoebs , how can you be married ?
well , i mean , i 'm not married married , ya know , he 's just a friend and he 's gay and he 's just from canada and he just needed a green card .
i can 't believe you married duncan . i mean how could you not tell me ? we lived together , we told each other everything .
i 'm sorry monica but i knew if i told you , you 'd get really , like , judgemental and you would not approve .
of course i wouldn 't approve , i mean , you were totally in love with this guy who , hello , was gay . i mean , what the hell were you thinking ?
you see , and you thought she 'd be judgemental .
ok , i wasn 't in love with him and i was just helping out a friend .
please , when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and i saw you eat a cheeseburger .
huuh .
well , didn 't you ?
i might have .
i can 't believe you didn 't tell me .
oh , c 'mon , like you tell me everything .
what have i not told you ?
oh , i don 't know . umm , how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with fun bobby out on the terrace .
what
wait a minute , who told you ? you are dead meat .
i didn 't know it was a big secret .
oh it 's not big , not at all , you know , kinda the same lines as , say , oh i don 't know , having a third nipple .
you have a third nipple ?
you bitch .
whip it out , whip it out .
c 'mon , there 's nothin to see , it 's just a tiny bump , it 's totally useless .
oh as , as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples ?
i can 't believe you . you told me it was a nubbin .
joey , what did you think a nubbin was ?
i don 't know , you see somethin , you hear a word , i thought that 's what it was . let me see it again .
yeah , show it . show it . the nubbin , the nubbin , the nubbin .
joey was in a porno movie .
huuh .
if i 'm goin down , i 'm takin everybody with me .
you were in a porno ?
ahh , alright , alright , alright , i was young and i just wanted a job , ok . but at the last minute i couldn 't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can 't cause there 's people havin sex on it .
that is wild .
so what 's it shaped like ?
yeah , is there a hair on it ?
what happens if you flick it ?

so , uh , does it do anything , you know , special ?
why yes ross , pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia .
you know , in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility . you get the best huts and women dance naked around you .
huh ? are , uh , any of these cultures , per chance , in the tri-state area ?
you know , you are so amazing , is there anything you , you don 't know ?
ooh , julie 's so smart , julie 's so special .
look honey , i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did . but he 's with her now and you 're just gonna have to get over it .
ohh , i 'm gonna have to get over it . god , see i didn 't know that 's i had to do , i just have to get over it .

woah .
foxy lady .
where you goin ?
um , i 'm gonna go meet duncan , he 's skating tonight at the garden , he 's in the capades .
the ice capades ?
no , no the gravel capades . yeah , the turns aren 't as fast but when snoopy falls . . . funny .
i can 't believe you 're dressing up for him . i mean , you 're just , you 're setting yourself up all over again .
ok , no . for your information i 'm going to see him so i can put all those feeling behind me . ok , and the reason i 'm dressed like this is because i think it 's nice to look nice for your gay husband .
oh , darnit , we 're all out of milk . hey chandler , would you fill me up here ?
oh i see , i see , because of the third nipple thing . ha ha ha ha . . .

sure .
but now i know i don 't have a choice about this , i was born this way .
i , i don 't know what to say . i mean , you know , you 're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says , oh , i 'm not gay .
i 'm , i 'm still me .
why couldn 't you have just figured this out six years ago ?

you know , it still smells like monkey in there .

even though you do do a good bob impression , i 'm thinkin when she sees you tomorow , she 's probably gonna realize , hey , you 're not bob .

we 're just tryin to do a nice thing here .
ross , you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big .
actually , it makes us feel that big .
i don 't , i don 't understand . i mean , you , it 's like we can 't win with you guys .
if you guys feel this big , maybe that 's not our fault . maybe that 's just how you feel .
oh , now you 're tellin us how you feel .
ok , we never shoulda talked about this .
i 'm just gonna pass on the concert , cause i 'm just not in a very hootie place right now .
me neither .
me too .
guys , we bought the tickets .
oh , well , then you 'll have extra seats , you know , for all your tiaras and stuff .
why did you look at me when you said that ?
well , i guess now we can 't go .
what ? come on , you do what you want to do . do we always have to do everything together ?
you know what ? you 're right .
fine .
fine .
fine .

so , uh , how was he ?
eh .
eh ?
oh , bob , he was nothing compared to you . i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name .
well , that makes me feel so good .
it was just so awkward and bumpy .
bumpy ?
well , maybe he had some kind of uh , new , cool style , that you 're not familiar with . and uh maybe you have to get used to it .
well there really wasn 't much time to get used to it , you know what i mean ?

you know what ? i 'm not gonna be able to enjoy this .
yeah , i know , it 's my birthday . we all should be here .
so , let 's go .

let me get this straight . he got you to beg to sleep with him , he got you to say he never has to call you again , and he got you thinking this was a great idea .

ooh , what 'cha gonna do , fat boy , huh ? what ?
nothing , except tell you , uh , i think it 's wonderful how much energy you have .
well , thanks .
i mean , especially considering how tough it 's been for you to find work .
well , you know .
you know , i mean , you can 't tell your parents you were fired because they 'd be disappointed .
uh-huh .
and it 's not as if you have a boyfriend 's shoulder to cry on .
well no , but um .
i mean , if it were me , i think i 'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all .
y 'know , i try to stay positive . . .
so , you feel like goin for a run ?
alright .
because , you know , you don 't have to . if you want , you could just take a nap right here .

ok , all right , let 's hear about the kiss . was it like , was it like a soft brush against your lips ? or was it like a , you know , a i gotta have you now kind of thing ?
well , at first it was really intense , you know . and then , oh , god , and then we just sort of sunk into it .
ok , so , ok , was he holding you ? or was his hand like on your back ?

wow . what are you gonna use it for ?
games and stuff .
there are no jobs . there are no jobs for me .
wait , here 's one . uh , would you be willing to cook naked ?
there 's an ad for a naked chef ?
no , but if you 're willing to cook naked , then you might be willing to dance naked . and then

hi .
hey , oh , so , um how 'd you make out last night ?
that , that is funny . that is painfully funny . no , wait . wait , yeah , that 's just painful
wait a minute . i thought last night was great .
yeah , it was , but i get home , ok , and i see julie 's saline solution on my night table . and i 'm thinking to myself , oh my god , what the hell am i doing ? i mean , here i am , i am with julie , this incredible , great woman ,
you got all that from saline solution ?
we are talking about rachel here . you and rachel .
believe me , i 've been dreaming about me and rachel for ten years now . but now , i 'm with julie , so it 's like me and julie , me and rachel , me and julie , me and rachel . rachel , rachel .

ok , um , hi , hello , hi , ok , so , um , this is a song about a love triangle between three people that i made up . um , it 's called , um , two of them kissed last night .

there was a girl , we 'll call her betty , and a guy let 's call him neil . now i can 't stress this point too strongly , this story isn 't real . now our neil must decide , who will be the girl that he casts aside . will betty be the one who he loves

this is a nice resume . nice , nice , nice . muy impressivo .
so , mr. rastatter , what exactly does this job entail ? the ad wasn 't too clear .
mockolate .
i 'm sorry ?
mockolate . it 's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute .
ohh .

go ahead . try a piece . yeah , we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate .
all right . mmm-mmm .

yeah ?
i love how it crumbles . now see , your chocolate doesn 't do that .
no , ma 'am . well , anyhoo , we should be getting our f.d.a. approval any day now , hopefully , in time for thanksgiving . see , the way we look at it , chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays easter , christmas , what have you .
mmm-mmm .
but , we 're thinking , given the right marketing , we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday .
wow .
aren 't you going to swallow that ?
just waiting for it to stop bubbling .
yeah , isn 't that great ?
mmm .
well , anyhoo , um , we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving-themed recipes . you think you might be interested ?
abso lutely . see , i love creating new recipes . i love thanksgiving . and , well , now , i love mockolate .
really ?
especially the after taste , you know , i 'll tell ya , that 'll last ya till christmas .

how about mockolate mousse ?
it 's not , it 's not very thanksgiving-y .
ok , how about pilgrim mockolate mousse ?
what makes it pilgrim ?
we 'll put buckles on it .

hey .
hey .
hey .
did uh , ross call ?
no , i 'm sorry .
why didn 't he call ? he 's gonna stay with julie , isn 't he ? he 's gonna stay with her and she 's going to be all , hi , i 'm julie , ross picked me , and we 're gonna to get married , have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together .
no offense , but that sounds nothing like her .

i don 't know what to do . what am i gonna do ? i mean , this , this is like a complete nightmare .
oh , i know . this must be so hard . oh , no . two women love me . they 're both gorgeous and sexy . my wallet 's too small for my fifties , and my diamond shoes are too tight .
hey , here 's a thought , ross .
don 't touch the computer . don 't ever touch the computer .
ross , listen . i got two words for you . threesome .

ok , all right , look . let 's get logical about this , ok ? we 'll make a list . rachel and julie , pros and cons . oh . we 'll put their names in bold , with different fonts , and i can use different colors for each column .
can 't we just use a pen ?
no , amish boy .
ok , let 's start with the cons , cause they 're more fun . all right , rachel first .
i don 't know . i mean , all right , i guess you can say she 's a little spoiled sometimes .
you could say that .
and i guess , you know , sometimes , she 's a little ditzy , you know . and i 've seen her be a little too into her looks . oh , and julie and i , we have a lot in common cause we 're both paleontologists , but rachel 's just a waitress .
waitress . got it . you guys wanna play doom ? or we could keep doing this . what else ?
i don 't know .
oh , her ankles are a little chubby .
ok , let 's do julie . what 's wrong with her ?
she 's not rachel .

ok , this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust . this is mockolate cranberry cake , and these are mockolate chip cookies . just like the indians served .

oh my god , i can 't believe you let me put this in my mouth .

oh , oh sweet lord this is what evil must taste like

hey , so how 'd it go with julie ? did you , did you break her heart ?

no , no , see ? see ? hey , it 's printing . hey , it 's printing

well what is it ? let me see .

hey , someone order a coat ?
ross , chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won 't let me see .
he won 't ? he won 't because , isn 't that , isn 't that the , the short story you were writing ?
yes , yes it is , short story , that i was writing .
and i 'm in it ? then let me read it .
no
come on .
hey , uh , why don 't you read it to her ?

alright . it was summer , and it was hot . rachel was there . a lonely gray couch . oh , look , cried ned , and then the kingdom was his forever . the end .
that 's it ? that 's all you wrote ? you 're the worst writer in the whole world .
all right , you know what ? this isn 't funny anymore . there 's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it .
no , you don 't .
all right , you know what , that 's fine . if you guys want to be children about this , that 's fine . i do not need to see it .
what is this ? ross , what is this ?
good luck .

ok , just , just remember how crazy i am about you , ok ?
kind of ditzy ? too into her looks ? spoiled ?
now that 's a little spoiled . he was supposed to type little , the idiot .
just a waitress ?
no , that , that was , i mean , as opposed to uh , the uh , ok . is this over yet rach ?
oh i do not have chubby ankles

no , no , wait , ok , ok , look at the other side . look at julie 's column .
she is not rachem . what the hell 's a rachem ? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn 't know because i 'm just a waitress .

no , rach , come on . rach rach , no , no she 's not rachel , she is , she is not , ra--rachel ?

my diary my diary , that 's brilliant . i should have told her it was my diary , she never would have made me read her my diary .
you know , that 's true . you 'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency .
i i cannot believe ross even made this list . what a dinkus .
hey , cut him some slack . it was chandler 's idea .
what ?
what ?
oh good , i was hoping that would come up .
this was your idea ?
what were you thinking ?
all right , let 's get some perspective here , ok ? these things , they happen for a reason .
yeah . you
all right , pheebs , back me up here , ok ? you believe in that karma crap , don 't you ?
yeah , by the way , good luck in your next life as a dung beetle .

rach whoops rach , hey , open up , please
when somebody does not buzz you in , ross , that means go away . that doesn 't mean please climb up the fire escape .
i just wanna read something . it 's your pro list .
not interested .

ok , ok , number one the way you cry at game shows . number two how much you love your friends . number three the way you play with your hair when you 're nervous . number four how brave you are for starting your life over . number five how great you are with ben .

number six the way you smell .
hey , ross what are you doin ?
hey , joey . you wanna open the window ?
oh , yeah , i do .

what are you doing out there ?
i am , uh , i am
oh , you must be freezing . you know what you need ? how about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate ?

rach , come on , open up . rach , come on , come on , rach . you got to give me another chance .

no .
no ?
that 's what i said .
look , maybe we should go ?
no , you guys , you really don 't have to go , we 're done talking .
rach , come on , look , i know how you must feel .
no , you don 't , ross . imagine the worst things you think about yourself . now , how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too , but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you .
no , but , but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things .
oh , well , that 's , that 's mighty big of you , ross . i said don 't go
you know what ? you know what ? if , things were the other way around , there 's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you .
well , then , i guess that 's the difference between us . see , i 'd never make a list .

i never know how long you 're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again , you know ? maybe a little longer .

now , in some of these recipes , the quantities may seem just a little unusual , uh , like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars . i 've indicated four cups of coconut , and four cups of crushed nut , and only , uh , one tablespoon of mockolate .
doesn 't matter .
what ?
our fda approval didn 't come through . something about laboratory rats .
oh , gosh , i 'm sorry .
yeah , well , anyhoo , here is your check . thank you for all the trouble you went through . um , listen , you didn 't eat a lot of it while you were cooking , did you ?
well , uh , i ate some .
oh , some , that 's fine . some is fine . some is not a lot . so , it doesn 't burn when you pee , does it ?

hello ?

hi .
is that him again ? tell him i 'd come to the phone , but my ankles are weighin me down .
listen , i i don 't think this is the best time .
look , can , can you do something for me ?
sure , what ? ok , ok . music ?

the next one 's dedicated to rachel from ross . rachel , he wants you to know he 's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him .

uh , we 've just gotten a call from rachel , and she told us what ross did . it 's pretty appalling , and ross , if you 're listening , i don 't wanna play your song anymore . why don 't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance ? avery , michelle 's

hi , thanks for coming in again .
oh , not at all . i have no morals and i need the cash .
it 's like i 'm lookin in a mirror . anyway , they 're called fishtachios . they taste exactly like pistachios , but they 're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits . here , try one . you 're not allergic to anything , are you ?

money is so impersonal . cookies says someone really cares . . . alright , we 're broke , but cookies do say that .

although , you know what ? you might want to consider wearing underwear next time . yeah , cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your royal subject .
here it is , here it is . the only thing worse than the mindless , adolescent direction was joseph tribbiani 's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king .
ok , look , that is one guy 's opinion , alright . phoebs , read yours .
ok . the only thing worse than the mindless , adolescent direction
does anyone have one from a different paper ? ross , read yours .

but i 'm gonna be there for the rest of my life . i mean , i can 't break up with him . i 'm the one who made him quit drinking . he 's dull because of me .
alright , don 't say that . he 's probably always been dull . you just , you know , set it free .

yeah , she 's totally good looking . i mean , if i met her in a bar , or something , i 'd be buying her breakfast . you know , after having slept with her .
y 'know , maybe this isn 't such a big deal . y 'know , i mean , the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex . y 'know , i mean , throw in a tree and a fat guy and you 've got christmas .
i just i just don 't think that i want it that way though , y 'know ? i mean , let 's say i do make it , alright ? i 'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of y 'know , the little general .
didn 't you used to call it the little major ?
yeah , but after denise demarco , i had to promote it .

can i get you something from the bar ?
yes , i would like something . no , no thank you .
if if you want to drink , it 's ok with me , i 've got to get used to it .
no , no really . i i wouldn 't feel right about it . just some water .
so the light went out in my refrigerator
i 'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist .

hey , we 're having some fun now , huh , ross ? wanna do another one , huh russ ? ok eleven letters , atomic element number 101 ends in ium .

so what 'd you do ?
well , i couldn 't do it . i told her i didn 't want to get the part that way .

as in , i now pronounce you wife and wife married ?
anyway , we 'd like you to come , but we totally understand if you don 't want to .
why wouldn 't i want to come ? i had fun at the first wedding .
look i just thought that
no no no , i mean , hey , why shouldn 't i be happy for you ? what would it say about me if i couldn 't revel in your joy ? i 'm revelling baby , believe me
is your finger caught in that chair ?
mmm hmmm .
want us to go ?
uh-huh .

this is so cool . you 're actually gonna be on television .
it really hit me last night . i 'm gonna be on days of our lives . and then i started thinkin about all of u , and how these are the days of our lives
yes carol and susan 's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend , and she 's in a full body cast .
ross , chandler joey yes
they want me to do it , which is really cool , seeing as i 've never catered before , and i really need the money , and this isn 't a problem for you , is it ?
would it matter ?
oh , you are so great thank you
are you really not going ?
i am really not going . i don 't get it . they already live together , why do they need to get married ?
they love each other , and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them .
if you wanna call that a reason .
who 's the bitterest man in the living room , the bitterest man in the living room ? hi , neighbor .
ross , i thought you were over this .
look , that has nothing to do with this , ok ? she 's my ex-wife . if she were marrying a guy , none of you 'd expect me to be there .
hey , if she were marrying a guy , she 'd be like the worst lesbian ever .
did i miss it ? did i miss it ?
no , i 'm on right after this guy shoots himself .
whoa , she 's pretty .
yeah , and she 's really nice too . she taught me all about how to work the cameras , and smell-the-fart acting .
i 'm sorry , what ?
what ?
it 's like , you got so many lines to learn so fast , that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one . so while you 're thinkin of it , you take this big pause where you look all intense , you know , like this .
oh , ok .
there 's my scene , there 's my scene . mrs. wallace , i 'm dr. drake ramoray , your sister 's neurosurgeon .
is she gonna be all right ?
i 'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected . your sister is suffering from a subcranial hematoma . perhaps we can discuss this over coffee .
nice
that 's great
excellent
for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin to smell something .

that is so good do it again
all right , all right . damnit braverman , it 's right there on the chart
that 's great . all right , i gotta get to work , i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect .
no no , that 's me .
oh , yeah .
oh , hello .
oh , thanks . i couldn 't uh
is everything ok ?
um , no , huh-uh . one of my clients died on the massage table today .
oh my god .
that 's a little more relaxed than you want them to get .
yeah , um , she was 82 years old . her name was um , mrs. adelman .
oh , honey .
yeah , it 's just so strange . i mean , she probably woke up today and thought , ok , i 'll have some breakfast , and then i 'll take a little walk , and then i 'll have my massage . little did she know god was thinking , ok , but that 's it . oh
what do you mean ?
i think it went into me .

god , this is so hard . i can 't decide between lamb or duck .
well , of course , lambs are scarier . otherwise the movie would 've been called silence of the ducks .
ok , who ordered what ?
oh , i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .
yes , and this with the cigarette butt in it , is that decaf ?
oh god .
i can 't believe you 're so uptight about your mom comin .
i know , but it 's just it 's the first time , and i just don 't want her to think that because i didn 't marry barry , that my life is total crap , you know ?
talk about crap . try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time .
uh , pheebs , how long do you think this lady 'll be with us ?
i don 't know . i mean , she obviously has some kind of unfinished business . sit up
there she is .
mom
sweetie so this is where you work ? oh , it 's wonderful is it a living room ? is it a restaurant ? who can tell ? but i guess that 's the fun .
pretty much .
monica you look gorgeous last time i saw you , it was eat or be eaten .
this is joey , and phoebe , and this is chandler , and you remember ross .
oh hello , ross .
hi , mrs. green .
so , what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job ?
oh mom
if you didn 't pour the coffee , no one would have anything to drink .
believe me , sometimes that happens .
this is just so exciting . you know , i never worked . i went straight from my father 's house to the sorority house to my husband 's house . i am just so proud of you .
really ?
yes .
i know who it is you remind me of . evelyn dermer . course , that 's before she got the lousy face lift . now she looks like soupy sales .
pheebs , who 's evelyn dermer ?
i don 't know . who 's soupy sales ?

oh my god , there 's an unattractive nude man playing the cello .
yeah , well just be glad he 's not playing a smaller instrument .
you have some life here , sweetie .
i know . and mom , i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn 't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything , but this is just so much better for me , you know ?
i do . you didn 't love barry . and i 've never seen you this happy . i look at you and i think , oh , this is what i want .
for me .
well , not just for you .
well , what do you mean ?
i 'm uh , considering leaving your father .
all right . tell me if this is too cute . lesbian wedding , chicken breasts .
oh god . i think i 'm gonna be sick .
why ? it 's not like i 'm putting little nipples on them .
and you had no idea they weren 't getting along ?
none .
they didn 't fight a lot ?
no they didn 't even talk to each other . god , how was i supposed to know they were having problems ?
in my day , divorce was not an option .
hey , look who 's up .
i just can 't believe this is happening . i mean , when i was little , everybody 's parents were getting divorced . i just figured as a grownup i wouldn 't have to worry about this .
is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering ? i mean , she 's doing it because she wants to be more like you .
well , then , you know , couldn 't she have just copied my haircut ?
you know , it 's funny when my parents got divorced , they sent me to this shrink , and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves . but in your case it 's actually kinda true .
that 's him .
damn . my mail order grandfather hasn 't come yet .
phoebe ?
yes , hi , mr. adelman . thanks for meeting me .
oh , that 's all right , although you did cut into my busy day of sitting .
um , do you wanna sit ?
oh , no , please , i spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up . now uh , what can i do for you , my dear ?
i don 't know how to say this , but i think when your wife 's spirit left her body , it um , kind of stuck around in me .
you 're saying , my wife is in you ?
yeah . ok , you don 't have to believe me but um , can you think of any unfinished business she might have had , like any reason she 'd be hanging around ?
well , i don 't know what to tell you dear . the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died , she wanted to see everything .
everything ?
everything .
whoa , that 's a lot of stuff .
oh , wait , i remember , she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time .
i 'm sorry , there 's laughing in my head .
worth a shot , huh ?

look at this .
these are from halloween three years ago .
oh , look , here 's barry . did he have to come straight from the office ?
no , that was his costume . see , he 's actually an orthodontist , but he came as a regular dentist .
um , you guys , you know when i said before , thank you , but i don 't really need your help ?
actually , what i think you said was , don 't touch that , and get the hell out of my kitchen .
really ? weird . anyway , see , i planned everything really well . i planned and i planned and i planned . it just turns out , i don 't think i planned enough time to actually do it .
hey , mon , you want some help ?
if you want .
hey . what a day . i took her everywhere . the museum of modern art , rockefeller center , statue of liberty .
she 's still with you ?
yeah . i guess she hasn 't seen everything yet . i 'll be right back , she has to go to the bathroom again . oh , such a pretty face .
this is so much fun , just the girls . you know what we should do ? does anybody have any marijuana ?
god
all right , look , nobody 's smoking pot around all this food .
that 's fine . i never did it . i just thought i might . so , what 's new in sex ?
oh what 's new in sex ?
the only man i 've ever been with is your father .
i 'm dicing , i 'm dicing , i don 't hear anything .
i mean , this is no offense to your dad , sweetie , but i was thinking there might be more .
oh , i 'm sorry . you know what ? i cannot have this conversation with you . i mean , god , you just come in here , and drop this bomb on me , before you even tell daddy . what ? what do you want ? do you want my blessing ?
no .
you want me to talk you out of it ?
no .
then what ? what do you want ?
i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this .
why on earth would i understand this ?
you didn 't marry your barry . i did .
oh .
all right people , we 're in trouble here . we 've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left . move , move , move
monica , i feel like you should have german subtitles .
joey , speed it up
i 'm sorry , it 's the pigs. they 're reluctant to get in the blankets
monica , how did this happen ? i thought you had this all planned out .
do you want me to cry ? is that what you want ? do you wanna see me cry ?
sir no sir
all right , you
no . look , i told you i am not a part of this thing .
all right , look , ross . i realize that you have issues with carol and susan , and i feel for you , i do . but if you don 't help me cook , i 'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs , and i 'm gonna create a new appetizer called pigs in ross

carol , what 's the matter ? what happened ?
my parents called this afternoon to say they weren 't coming .
oh my god .
i mean , i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing , but they 're my parents . they 're supposed to give me away and everything .
it 's ok . i 'm sorry .
and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding , and she said we weren 't doing it for them , we were doing it for us , and if i couldn 't see that , then maybe we should call off the wedding . i don 't know
i uh can 't believe i 'm gonna say this , but i think susan 's right .
you do ?
look , do you love her ? and you don 't have to be too emphatic about this .
of course i do .
well then that 's it . and if george and adelaide can 't accept that , then the hell with them . look , if my parents didn 't want me to marry you , no way that would have stopped me . look , this is your wedding . do it .
you 're right . of course you 're right .
so we 're back on ?
we 're back on .
you heard the woman . peel , chop , devil i can 't believe i lost 2 minutes .

oh , yeah

can 't get the monkey off your back ? then put it in your mouth

with monkeyshine beer . monkeyshine beer , cause it 's a jungle out there .

that commercial always makes me so sad .
yeah , but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him , so , everything seems to work out ok .
i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel .
i can see that , cause they both have those big brown eyes and , ya know , the little pouty chin . monica and the fact that they 're both monkeys .
sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing , ya know , giving him away .
oh , ross , you had to , i mean , he was humping everything in sight . i mean , i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding .
remember when sometimes he 'd borrow your hat , and , and when you got it back there 'd be little monkey raisins in it .
yeah , well sure , when he did it , it was funny . when i did it to my boss 's hat . . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem .

hey , hey , check it out , guess what i got .
rhythm ?
no , my first fan mail .
alright
dear dr. remore , know that i love you and would do anything to have you . gosh . your not-so-secretive admirer , erica ford . ooh wait , ps enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes .
ya know , in crazy world , that means you 're married .
this wasn 't addressed to days of our lives , this is , this came to your apartment . there 's no stamp on it , this woman was in our building .
oh my god , i got my very own stalker .

hey guys .
hey .
ooh , where are you off to , travelin jake ?
well , there 's this , uh , paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i 'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel .
you know i think he will be surprised , till he realizes he 's a monkey , and uh , you know , isn 't capable of that emotion .

oh , phoebe , that really cute guy is here again .
oh , oh , ok , so everyone , pretend like i 'm telling you a story , ok . and , and it 's really funny . so everyone just laugh , now .

i know , i know . hello .

hi rob dohnen .
i don 't know anything about music , but i think you 're really , really great .

oh , i would love to have kids . . . you 're , you 're the , you 're , me play the songs that i will write for them .

hey , whaddya wanna do for dinner ?
well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves .

hello .
it 's erica .
ah , the stalker .
never mind , it 's open .
yes , hitting her with a frying pan 's a good idea . we might wanna have a backup plan , though , just in case she isn 't a cartoon .
let 's get out of here .

the one time they 're not home .
ok , we 'll just leave , and when we pass her on the stairs , she won 't know it 's me cause we 've never met . chandler that 's how radio stars escape stalkers .
she 's comin .

it 's me .
uhh , this is it , this is how we 're gonna die . ready ?
wait , wait , wait .

hi .
erica .

hi , dean lipson , zoo administrator . i was told you had a question .
well , i uh , i can 't seem to find the monkey i donated last year . he 's a capuchan , answers to the name marcel .
ahh , i 'm afraid i have some bad news . marcel has passed on .
oh my god , what happened ?
well he got sick , and then he got sicker , and then he got a little better but then he died .
i can 't believe this .
i 'm sorry mr. geller . but ya know , there 's an old saying , sometimes monkeys die . it 's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today .
well , ya know , someone should have called me .
i 'm sorry . look , i know this can 't bring him back but here , it 's just a gesture .
zoo dollars ?
yes , and come see the bird show at 4 . the macaws wear hats . well it 's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn 't just died .

ooohhh .
i know .
i can 't believe joey 's having lunch with his stalker . what i- , what is she like .
well , you remember cathy bates in misery ?
yeah .
well , she looks the exact opposite of that .
and she 's not crazy ?
oh no no no , she 's a total wack job . yeah , she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore .
oh my god .
ah , and i mean , he 's going out with her ? he can not persue this .
hey , just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn 't mean she 's not a person . i mean , does she not deserve happiness , does she not deserve love ? what 're you lookin at me for ? he 's the one who wants to boff
you ok ?
no , uh-uh , i 'm just , i 'm nervous . so , you know what , maybe if i just , if i picture them all in their underwear .
that 's not a good idea , that 's kinda the reason the last guy got fired .
i 'm just , i 'm , i 'm , i 'm used to playing for grown-ups . ya know , they just , grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing , ya know , and kids listen . this is a huge responsibility . what ? are you gonna kiss me ?
i was thinkin about it .
ok . ok , alrighty , let 's play some tunes . hi everybody , i 'm phoebe

yeah it is . . . what ?
well , here we sit , devil may care , just a little while ago you were reattaching someone 's spinal cord .

no , no no no , you don 't have to tell me anything . you don 't have to explain yourself to me . ooh , who am i to question the great dr. drake remore ?

i have no idea . did you know richard has a twinkie in the city ?
i know . he 's like a new man . it 's like a scene from cocoon .
i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo .
apparently , he told johnny shapiro that she 's quite a girl . in fact , he told johnny that he thinks he 's falling in love with her .
really .
i tell you , i 've never seen him this happy .

eddie , i didn 't sleep with your ex-girlfriend .

this is nuts . this is crazy . she came over for like two minutes , dropped off a fish tank , and left , end of story .
where 's buddy ?
buddy ?
my fish , buddy .
there was no fish when she dropped it off .

animal sex , animal sex ? so what 're you saying , i mean , you 're saying that like , there 's nothing between us animal at all . i mean there 's not even like , uhm , a little animal , not even , not even like , like chipmunk sex ?
ok , ross , try to hear me . ok , i , hey , i 'm not gonna lie to you . ok , it was good with paolo .
knock-knock .

well for starters , you may want to light it and lose the spatula .
you know what , i think it 's cute , you trying to be more like richard .
not like him , per-se , just not un-like him .

look it 's the artist formerly known as chandler .
just tryin somethin here , ya know .
so joey , why didn 't you grow a moustache ?
oh we flipped for it . i got the cigar , he got the moustache . figured if we both grew it , we 'd look like dorks .
yeah , you really sidestepped that land mine .
hey listen , we 've gotta go , i promised richard we 'd meet him downstairs .
you 're meeting richard ?
yeah , we 're goin to a ranger game .
yeah , didn 't he tell ya ?
well , he told me he was going out with the guys , i just didn 't know that you were the guys .
you hear that ? we 're the guys .
we 're the guys .
with that moustache doesn 't chandler remind you of aunt sylvia ?
thank you .

hi , we 're visitiing . it 's ben and his da-da . da-da . can you say da-da ? look , i 'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try .
no luck huh ?
naa . a while ago i got a sah out of him , which i thought , ya know , might turn into sah-condary caregiver but hey , would you uh , would you hold him for a sec , cause i , i gotta take this off .
oh , yeah sure , ok .
what 're you doing ?
uh , i 'm holding ben .
yeah , well , he 's a baby not a bomb .
ok .
well just hold him like you 'd hold a football .
this is how i would hold a football .
ok , here , here . there we go .
ok , i 'm sorry , i 'm just not very good with babies . i mean i haven 't been around them , i mean , you know , since i was one .
it 's alright , it 's no big deal .
really ?
yeah , definitely , i 'm sure you 'll feel totally different when it 's our baby .
what ?
what ?
you think about stuff like that ?
uhh , yeah . i mean , actually i kinda think that we 'll have , we 'll have two babies .
two , two babies ?
yeah . ya know , a boy and a girl . hopefully the girl will come first so ben here won 't feel too competitive .
then what 's gonna happen ?
well , we won 't wanna raise kids in the city so we 'll probably move to uh , scarsdale .
uh-huh .
yeah , that way i figure , ya know , we 'll be far enough away from our parents that we don 't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want . and yes , i know , the taxes are a little higher than , let 's
wow . wow , that 's great . great . ok , wow , you know what .
huh ?
i 'm off my break now so uh , um here you take this and um , i am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee . ok . oh look at that , i don 't have a pot . i don 't have a pot . well , hey , maybe i 've got one at

hey .
hey phoebs , what 's happening ?
oh , ok , murder , cancer , soccer teams eating each other in the andes .
so you watched the movies huh ?

alright that 's great , then just go . go knicks .
uh , it 's the college playoffs .
oh , then go vassar .
uh , they 're not in it .
ok , then just go .
ok .
oh , why does this bother me so much ? i mean i don 't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them .
sure .
it 's just that he doesn 't have that much free time , ya know , and i don 't know , what do i do ?
does it matter ? you 're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off .
aghh .
me too .
i 've got a question . richard made plans again with the guys .
yeah well , ross just made plans for the whole century .
ya know what , i think i 'm gonna go to my room and read cosmo , maybe there 's something helpful in there . know what , at least maybe i can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover cristmas candles .
ok , what the hell happened back there ?
i don 't know , you tell me . one minute i 'm holding ben like a football , the next thing i know , i 've got two kids , i 'm living in scarsdale complaining about the taxes .
well i 'm sorry , i think about stuff . ya know , i mean , you 're at work , you 're assembling bones , your mind wanders .
ross , you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives , we 've been dating for six weeks .
c 'mon , what , you never think about our future ?
yes , but i , i think about who 's apartment we 're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and , and where we 're gonna have dinner next saturday night . i do not think about what our childrens names are gonna be . you know what our childrens names are gonna be .
no , no , i mean , ya know , i , i read a book and there was a girl named emily and i thought , i thought that might be good .
what was the book ?
the big book of childrens names .
ok , ross , ross , ok listen , what we have is amazing .
yeah .
but i do not want to have everything decided for me . i spent my whole life like that . it 's what i had with barry , that was one of the reasons i left . i , i like not knowing right now and i 'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with
ok fine .
thank you .
we 're not done .
i didn 't know that .
ok , then you 're gonna have to understand that you 're with a guy who 's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we 're gonna end up together and if that scares you , tough , cause you 're gonna have to deal with that .
fine , i will .
good , cause i love you .
oh yeah .
yeah .
well i love you too .
well that 's the first time we 've said that .
yes it is .
well , i 'm gonna kiss you .
well you better .

hey . oh thanks for the great movie tip .
did you like it ?
oh yeah . you know , i don 't know if i was happier when um george bailey destroyed the family business or um , donna reid cried , or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed .
alright , i 'll give you the ear thing but don 't you think the ending was pretty wonderful ?
i didn 't watch the ending , i was too depressed . it just kept getting worse and worse , it should have been called , it 's a sucky life and just when you think it can 't suck any more it does .

kick save and denied .
but he gets it back , pass to the middle , lines it up and bam yes could that shot be any prettier ?
man you are incredible .
well , we had a table in college .
oh really , i didn 't know they had foosball in the 1800 's .
nice moustache by the way . when puberty hits that thing 's really gonna kick in .
honey . uh , not to sound too florence henderson but , dinner 's on the table .
ok , just one more point .

yeah , he 's just really great to hang around with .
well .

yeah , well they suck too .

suddenly i 'm seeing him go off to college .
we 've gotta go , we 've got that cab waiting .
alright , alright , ok . bye .

bye .
bye .
bye .
bye .

oh wow , look at this nice deep hole i 've been digging . hey bert , isn 't this a nice hole here . hey .
ok , ben , this is the part where ernie buries bert in the sand and can 't find him . now , i 've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again . but , ok , before that happens , there 's some pretty rough goin for a while but i think we can handle
bert , bert . bert . hey , what happened to my friend bert ? he was here just a moment ago . oh no , my old friend bert is lost .
oh , i 'm so glad you 're here .

so , i 'll get candles and my mom 's lace tablecloth , and since it 's rachel 's birthday , i mean , we want it to be special , i thought i 'd poach a salmon .
ohhh .
what ?
question . why do we always have to have parties where you poach things ?
you wanna be in charge of the food committee ?
question two . why do we always have to have parties with committees ?
really . why can 't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun ?
yeah .
yeah , i agree . ya know , i think fancy parties are only fun if you 're fancy on the inside and i 'm just not sure we are .
alright . if you guys don 't want it to be special , fine . you can throw any kind of party you want .

joey they 're not real . i start miles beneath the surface of these things , ok , they 're fake . see honk honk .
wow , it 's , it 's like porno for clowns .

i talked to rachel 's sisters , neither of them can come .
ok , um so , i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper .
woah , woah , woah , uh , no shannon cooper .
why not her ?
cause she uh , she steals stuff .
or maybe she doesn 't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back .
joey that is horriable .
hey i liked her , alright . maybe , maybe too much . i don 't know i guess i just got scared .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't know .
i didn 't think anyone 'd buy that , ok .

hi honey , how did it go ?
agh , it was the graduation from hell .
ya know , my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship .
ya know , i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion . my sister 's graduating from college , nobody thought she would . it 's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica .
so what happened ?
my parents happened . all they had to do was sit in the same stadium , smile proudly , and not talk about the divorce . but nooo , they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address . bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them . but you know what , you know
ok , so i guess we don 't invite her parents .
well , how bout just her mom ?
why her mom ?
cause i already invited her .
ooh , ooh , did you ask stacy roth ?
oh no , can 't invite her . she also steals .

ok , here are the birthday candles . where 's the birthday cake ?
ok , we 're not having birthday cake , we 're having birthday flan .
excuse me ?
it 's a traditional mexican custard dessert .
oh that 's nice . happy birthday rachel , here 's some goo .

dr. greene . oh my god it 's rachel 's dad . what 're you doing here ?
what ? the father can 't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday ?
no no , the father can , but um , since i am the roommate i can tell you that she 's not here and i 'll pass along the message , ok . so bye-bye .
ohhh , you 're having a parteee .
no , no , not a party . just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows . um , this is phoebe and chandler and joey .
i 'll never remember all of that . so uh , what 's the deal ? rachel comes home , people pop out and yell stuff , is that it ?
this isn 't your first surprise party , is it sir ?

hi monica .

chinese menu guy . forgot the menus .
so , basically just a chinese guy .
uh , hey , dr. greene , why don 't you come with me , we 'll put your jacket on rachel 's bed .
alright , that sounds like a two person job .
well , my goodness , what was that ?
sandra , i am so sorry , i thought you were rachel and we just weren 't ready for you yet .
you thought i was rachel ?
yes because uh , you look so young .
and because you 're both , you know , white women .
oh , i missed you kids . well , should i put my coat in the bedroom ?
no no , i 'll take that for ya .
oh well thank you . such a gentleman . thank you . ahh , it all looks so nice , so festive , all the balloons the funniest thing happened to me on the way here . i was

ok , now that your coat is safely in the bedr- , oh , ok we can come back out in the living room .
so uh , joey and chanlder , i , i think it 's time that you take dr. greene over to your place .
uhh , yes , absdolutely , um . why again ?
because that 's where the party is you goon . see this is just the staging area .

ooh , then i guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for . ok , i am going to take a shower and today i will be singing jim crochee 's leroy brown .

monica hey mon , i have a question . is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town ?
baddest . otherwise the song would be fat fat leroy brown .
what 're you doing ?
just waiting for you sweetie .
are you remaking the bed ?
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . you know what , the way you did it was just fine .
then , you 're redoing it because
if i tell you , you 'll think i 'm crazy .
you 're pretty much running that risk either way .
ok , you see , the tag shouldn 't be at the top left corner , it should be at the bottom right corner .
oh , well that 's not so crazy .
i 'm just easing you in .
oh , alright .
alright , you see these little flower blossoms ? they should be facing up , not down , because , well , the head of the bed is where the sun would be . you don 't love me any more do you .
actually , if it 's possible , i love you more .
really ? wow , well then come on , i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point .

hey , look joey , i 'm just saying if you need something to hold you over , i can get you a job right here as an entry level processor .
but don 't you need experience for a job like that ?
it 's not that hard to learn . and as for people realizing you have no idea what you 're doing , hey , you 're an actor . act like a processor , people will think you 're a processor .
hey chandler , here 's this morning 's projections .
hey thanks . scott alexander , joey tribbianni . joey is a uh , fellow processor .
no kidding .
oh yeah yeah . i process . people want the processing , i 'm the one they call .
where do you work ?
uhh , well , right now i 'm in between things . you know how it is . one day you 're processing , the next day you 're not so much processing any more .
i was just telling joey about the opening in fleischman 's group .
fleischman 's group . whatever you do , don 't touch his sandwiches . ha-ha-ha
ha-ha . are all you processors dorks ?

oh , this lipstick looks just great on you .

why aren 't you at home in bed ?
'cause my , my grandmother 's never had chicken pox . please , please tell me you have , cause oh my god , i forgot how cute you are .
i 'm sorry , i never had em .
ohh , ohh .
if i had one wish , it would be to build a time machine , go back to when i was 7 , when jimmy hauser had the chicken pox . i would grab that kid and rub him all over my face .
yeah , or you know , you could just wish that i didn 't have them now .
can i please see your face ?
nope . you don 't want to see a face covered with pox .
your face could be covered with lochs , i wouldn 't care .
and you hate fish . oh . that 's so sweet , alright . ok , alright , you can see . this is me oh , i am scary .
sorry , the lightning . lightning was an unfortunate incidence . you look lovely , lovely .
i hate this . cause i tell you , i had the most amazing two weeks planned for us , and almost everything i had in mind , we had to be a lot closer than this .
phoebe , i have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men , thinking about this moment . i am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us .
ok , this is the most romantic disease i 've ever had .

hey .
hey , how 's the first day goin ?
pretty good . it 's like you said . it 's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column .

jeannie , the head of east coast operations jeannie ?
yeah , turns out our kids go to the same school . small world huh ?
weird world . your kids ?
i figure my character has kids .
ya know there isn 't a part of that sentence i don 't need explained .
well , see when you 're acting you need to think about stuff like that . my character , joseph the processor guy , has two little girls , ashley and brittany . ashley copies everything brittany does .
well , invisible kids can be that way sometimes .
yeah . joseph and his wife , karen , are thinking of having a third kid ya know what ? just did .
really ? wow . that 's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there .

you know what makes the itching even worse ?
that you don 't stop talking about it .
fine .
let 's just play , ok . good , ok . here we go , double sixes , here we go here we go , come to mama , just getting ready to roll the dice

oh god help me .
now do me , do my back . oh come on , harder .

you know , i might have expected this of you phoebe , but ryan , you 're a military man .

you and milton have to join us on the boat . karen 'll pack a lunch , you 'll bring the kids , we 'll make a day of it .
oh , that sounds lovely . we 're gonna have to set that up . oh , i better get back . hope the baby feels better .
oh , thanks , thanks . bye bye jeannie .

well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families .
i have a family , i 'm gonna be here .
yeah bing , what 's that about ?
it 's about cutting my people a little slack , ya know , for morale . look , if you wanna see some rough numbers , i can get them to you by wednesday .
rough numbers ?
this company was not built on rough numbers . am i right mr. douglas .
have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday .
uh , if you say so sir .
joseph 's good , isn 't he ?
well , i 'm going to kill you .
hey , hey , i just figure joseph 's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up . ya know , get in there , ruffle some feathers .
why ?
look , i 'm sorry but that 's what joseph does , ok . if you try to pull somethin , he 'll call you on it . what 're you tryin to pull , he 'll say .

ooh , duct tape . was i supposed to bring something too ?
this is for the scratchy twins out there . i taped oven mits to their hands .
you 're strict .
it 's for their own good .
you know , i like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under . see in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time .
exactly . oh , i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now . tell me the truth . don 't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular ?
if it 's not a right angle , it is a wrong angle .
very good .
thank you .
you know what . tomorrow i 'm gonna do your clocks .
you 're gonna do what to my clocks .
i 'm gonna set them to my time .
well , i 'm confused . i thought we shared time .
no no . see , in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast . you wanna know why ?
because it 's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen .
no forget it , i 'm not gonna tell you now .
no come on . come on tell me .
no . see you don 't understand .
come on .
no . you don 't have any of these cute little obsessive things .
no that 's not true . that is not true .
oh yeah .
yeah .
alright , well tell me one of yours .
ok . ahh . one of my things is , i always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks .
what if they get mixed up ?
boy i would just uh , i would freak out .
you would not . i can 't believe this . i hate this , you 're too normal . i can 't believe my boyfriend doesn 't have a thing . my boyfriend doesn 't have a thing .
see , if anyone overheard that , i didn 't come off well .

hey . mr. douglas is looking for you .
why ? wh- wh- why is mr. douglas looking for me ?
'cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project .
wha- wh- why , why , why does he suspect that ?
becasue at first he thought it was joseph . but after he asked joseph about it , turns out it was you . anyway , i just thought you should know .
alright , that 's it . look joey , i 'm sorry , i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya , and if i could just fire joseph , i would , but unfortunately that 's not possible so i 'm gonna have to let both of you go .
what 're you talking about , everybody loves joseph .
i don 't , i hate joseph , ok . i think he 's a brown-nosing suck up .
oh yeah . well you can 't fire joseph . you know why , cause he 's not in your department .
alright , ok , alright . so i can 't fire joseph but uh , i can sleep with his wife .
karen .
yeah , karen . i 'm thinking about having an affair with her . oh , you know what ? i just did .
ahh . what the hell are you doing to me man .
oh well it 's not me , it 's my character , chandy . yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker 's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler . in fact , i have her panties right there in my drawer .
really ?
no freakshow , she 's fictional .
take it easy . if it means that much to you , i 'll uh , i 'll go find something else .
thank you .
it 's just that , i , i 'm gonna miss joseph . i liked him . his wife , she was hot .

can i please take these off ? i swear i won 't scratch .
no sorry hon , monica 's orders .
well that wasn 't easy .

ross , i didn 't think it would that big of a deal .
oh , she didn 't think it would be that big of deal .
okay , who are you talking to when you do that ?
look , that was supposed to be like a private , personal thing between us .
okay , ross , phoebe is my girlfriend , okay , we tell each other everything . you know , i mean , come on , guys do the same thing , i mean , what about all that locker room stuff .
that 's different , okay . that 's like , uh who dated a stripper ? or who did it on the back of the staton island ferry ? .
were both of those joey ?
yeah . look , you don 't , you don 't talk about like , you know , your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you , you do with her .
not even with your best friend .
noo
that is so sad . your missing out on so much , ross . i mean , the bonding and the sharing , you know . and-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are .
hmph . so what you , you tell each other everything ?
pretty much .
did you talk about the night of five times ? do you tell people about the night of five times ?
uh , honey , yeah that was with carol .
i know , but it 's still worth mentioning , i think .

relax every muscle in your body . listen to the plinky-plunky music . okay , now close you eyes , and think of a happy place . okay , tell me your happy place .
richard 's living room , drinking wine .
all right . no , no , no , not a richard thing , just put down the glass . and get out
i 'm sorry , but that 's my happy place .

all right , i 'll try not to .
okay , all right , so , your in a meadow , millions of stars in the sky
do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake ?
all right , there are no questions in the happy place . okay , just , the warm breeze , and the moonlight flowing through the trees
i 'll bet he 's totally over me , i 'll bet he 's fine .
all right , betting and wagering of any kind , are , i 'm sure , not permitted in the happy place . okay . just-just , you know , the-the lovely waterfalls , and the , the trickling fountains . and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook
okay , this isn 't working . i 'm still awake and now i have to pee .

so , i hear , you hate me
i , ah , i never said hate , i was very careful about that .
a little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me .
and you got a hate from that ? your taking a big leap there
all right , fine , fine , fine , fine , fine , we 've got to do something about our little situation here joey . so , this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together .
but what does that gonna do
for chandler
okay . i 'm in .
okay . all right . this is what we 're gonna call it joey and janice 's day of fun
does it have to be a whole day ?
yes , because that 's how long it takes to love me .
yeah , i know , i sleep in the next room .

so , i went down to the post office , and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered for richard about the civil war . he loved the civil war .
monica , do you want us to take you home ?
uh , huh . or maybe to a galaxy far , far away .
women tell each other everything . did you know that ?
umm , yeah .
no chandler , everything like stuff you like , stuff she likes , technique , stamina , girth
girth ? why , why , why , wh-why , why , why , why would they do this ?
rachel says sharing 's great and supposedly , you know , we outta be doing it . do you wanna ?
we 're not gonna talk about girth are we ?
nooo
yeah , okay .
yeah ?
yeah all right you go first .
okay , okay , i 'll go first .

okay .
okay .
okay , you know , you know when your in bed , with a woman .

and , ah , you know , your fooling around with her . and you get all these like , mental images in your brain , you know , like elle macpherson , or that girl at the xerox place
with the belly-button ring ? oh , muhawa
i know , and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head . and your like mom , get outta here you know , but of course , like , after that you can 't possibly think of anything else , and you can 't , you know , stop what your doing . so it 's
your mom , your telling me , your telling me , about your mom , what is the matter with you ?

it 's an empty apartment .
oooh .
we 're all alone in an empty apartment .
honey , come on , i have to be at work in like ten minutes oh , all right , well it 's not like i 'm employee of the year or anything .

there it is .
oh , oh , that 's what you 're talking about . hey .
hey .
do i look fat ?
noo .
okay , i accept that . when janice asked me and i said no , she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow .
okay , walk us through it , honey , walk us through it .
okay , well . janice said hi , do i look fat today ? and i , i looked at her
whoa , whoa , whoa . you looked at her . you never look . you just answer , it 's just a reflex . do i look fat ? nooo is she prettier than i am ? noo does size matter ?
nooo
and it works both ways .
okay , so you both just know this stuff ?
well you know , after about thirty or forty fights , you kinda catch on .
okay , for instance . let 's say , janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options . option number 1 she 'll take a cab home from the airport . option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim . which do you do ?
that 's easy , baggage claim .
wrong now you 're single . it 's actually secret option number three , you meet her at the gate . that way she knows you love her .
okay , this is good , this is good . all right listen , i have one . janice likes to cuddle , at night , which , you know i 'm all for . but , uh , you know when you want to go to sleep , you want some space . so , uh , how do
oh honey , i 'm sorry we can 't help you there , cause we 're cuddlily sleepers . okay , i 'm late for work .
oh .
all right are you guys gonna come down ?
uh , yeah , yeah i 'll , i 'm right behind you .
good luck chandler .
thank you rachel .
bye sweetie .
bye hon .

yeah .
i 'm gonna use the cushion .

okay , you 're in bed . she 's over on your side , cuddling . now you wait for her to drift off , and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed . and then you rollll a-way . hug for her roll for you .
okay , the old hug and roll .
yep .
okay , one question .
shoot .
you 're pretending the pillow 's a girl right ?

remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon ?
you 're so pretty .
hi
hey , phoebe .
hey , oh , you know that guy who 's been following me ? i talked to him today .
you talked to him . are you crazy ?
okay , first i 'm not crazy . and second , say it don 't spray it . anyway his name is malcom , and he wasn 't following me , i mean he was , but cause he thought i was ursula , ick . and , that 's why , that 's why he couldn 't just come
umm , not feeling better bout malcom .
ooh no , no , no , no , he 's not like a kook , no . he 's just like this , this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy , that got like a tinsy bit carried away , you know . and we just get along really well , and he 's so cute .
oh my god , you 've got a crush on your sister 's stalker .
no , i 'm just gonna help him , you know , get de-ursula-ized , like you know , like i did for joey after he went out with her .
hey , i didn 't stalk her . i mean
okay , i asked for the news , not the weather .
hey guys .

i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even . so , i 've got a new plan now . babies .
well , your gonna need much bigger jars .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm talking about me having a baby .
what ?
are you serious ?
yeah . the great thing about the jam plan was , i was taking control of my life . so i asked myself , what is the most important thing to me in the world and that 's when i came up with the baby plan .
well , aren 't you forgetin something ? what , what , what is uh , what is that guy 's name ? dad
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with , if i have to wait another 28 years then , i 'll be 56 before i can have a baby , and that 's just stupid .

noo way , kevin .
there is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you 'll never have to open up milk cartons again . meet the milk master 2000 .
are you intrigued ?

keep in mind , he 's never used this product before , you 're gonna see how easy this is to do . go ahead . this works with any milk carton .
wow , it is easy . now , i can have milk everyday .

well , it 's official there are no good movies .
well , let 's go to a bad one and make out .
perhaps , you would like me to turn like this , so that you can bunny bump against my back .
hey
hey .
hey , man . what 's up ?
maybe you can tell me . my agent would like to know why i didn 't show up at the audition i didn 't know i had today . the first good thing she gets me in weeks . how could you not give me the message ?
well , i 'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt , but , ah , it wasn 't me .
yes , it was it was him uh huh okay , it was me
how is it you ?
well , it was just , it was all so crazy , you know . i mean , chandler was in the closet , counting to 10 , and he was up to 7 and i hadn 't found a place to hide yet . i-i-i meant to tell you , and i wrote it all down on my hand
yep , that 's my audition .
see , now this is why i keep notepads everywhere .
yep , and that 's why we don 't invite you to play .
what is the great tragedy here ? you go get yourself another appointment .
well , estelle tried , you know . the casting director told her that i missed my chance .
that is unfair . i 'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault .
pheebs , you can 't do that . the casting director doesn 't talk to friends , she only talks to agents .
what a sad little life she must lead . okay , ooh .
what , what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
no , no , no , i know , i know , ooh . hi , this is katelynn , from phoebe buffay 's office . um , is um , ann there for phoebe , she 'll know what it 's about .
hang up , hang up .
annie hi . listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani , apparently he missed his audition . who did you speak to in my office ? estelle , no , i don 't know what i 'm going to do with her . no . all right , so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment , the
is anybody else scared ?
right , well look , um , if joey loses this audition , that is it for estelle . i don 't care annie you are a doll , what time can you see him ? i need a pen .
get the woman a pad get the woman a pad a pad a pad
oh , now you want a pad .

hey
there 's my boy here 's my boy and here 's his barbi what 's ah , what 's my boy doing with a barbi ?
he picked it out of the toy store himself , he loves it .
he carries it everywhere , it 's like a security blanket , but with ski boots and a kicky beret .
yeah , it 's , it 's , it 's cute . why , why , why does he have it , again ?
so he 's got a doll ? so what ? unless you 're afraid he 's gonna grow up and be in show business .
this doesn 't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women , does it ?
you know what it 's fine . if you 're okay with the barbi thing , so am i.

give daddy the barbi ben , give , give me the barbi . okay , how bout , don 't you want to play with the monster truck ? no . okay , oh , oh , how about a dino-soilder ?
ross , you are so pathetic . why can 't your son just play with his doll ?
i gotta go to work . has anybody seen my left boob ?
i love that movie .
there it is . joey , what are you doing ?
i 'm sorry , it just felt nice .
joe . joe answer the phone .
hey , i only got one good arm , you know . you should be doing stuff for me . go get me a sweater .
just do it okay , it 's janice and if i get it i 'm going to have to see her tonight . oh , that 's great i 'm gonna have to see her tonight .
what 's the big deal ? why don 't you wanna see janice ?
okay , last night at dinner , when the meals came , she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .
and that 's bad because , you hate chicken piccata ?
noo .
you didn 't want to share your tomatoes , tomatoes are very important to you .
no , it 's like all of the sudden , we were this couple . and this alarm started going off in my head run for your life get out of the building
men are unbelievable .
what is it with you people i mean , the minute you start to feel something , you have to run away ?
i know , that , that 's why i don 't want to go tonight , i 'm afraid i 'm going to say something stupid .
oh , you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you .
hey , you know about that ?
look what do i do ? i wanna get past this , i don 't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing . i wanna go through the tunnel , to the other side

where there is no fear of commitment .
do we have any do we have any thoughts here ?
well , i 've never been through the tunnel myself , cause as i understand it , you 're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right . but , it seems to me it 's pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear . it have a fear
amazingly , that makes sense .
you think ?
oh , yeah . go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind
yeah , joe , i assure you if i 'm staring down the barrel of a gun , i 'm pretty much peeing every which way .

oh , it 's your audition from this morning . can i use the phone again ?

well , wait there 's , there 's more . see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer . see , the drawer actually goes in my dresser .
oh , you didn 't have to do this .
yes , i did . yes , i did . because , you 're my girlfriend , and that 's what girlfriends should , should get .
well , i gotta buy a vowel . because , oh my gawd who , would 've thought that someday , chandler bing would buy me a drawer .

we should ?
yep , we 're a couple and that 's what couples do . and , i wanna meet your parents . we should take a trip with your parents
i don 't think we need to , because you 're tripping me out right now are you okay ?
i am , i actually am . i mean this is amazing . my entire life i have feared this place , and now that i 'm here it 's like what was the big deal . i could probably say let 's move in together . and i 'd be okay .

it doesn 't scare me
yeah , well , it scares me i mean i not even divorced yet , chandler . you know , you just invited me over here for pasta , and all of the sudden you 're talking about moving in together . and , and i wasn 't even that hungry . you know what , it 's getting a
oh , no , no , no , don 't go i 've scared ya i 've said too much i 'm hopeless , and awkward , and desperate for love hey , janice it 's me . um , yeah , i-i-i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street .

honey , this will help .
so , i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .
uff .
that is never good .
then i got all needy and clingy .
okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . maybe it 's not so bad . how did you leave it ?
she said she 'd call me .
ohh
oh god .
welcome to our side of the tunnel .
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way .
yeah , well that 's that lo-cal , non dairy , soy milk junk . we sort of , we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .
you know , when you start get screwed over all the time , you gotta switch to low-fat .
yeah , you do .
so , you don 't think i 'm terminal ?
well , no , not at all , you 're not terminal , you just , you just need some damage control .
okay , okay . so , should i call her ?
nooo
this is a very critical time right now . if you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath . you want her back you have to start acting aloof .
she has to know that your not ready .
right . so , what you have to do is , you have to accidentally run into her on purpose . and then act aloof .
so i 'm not , not gonna lose her ?
oooh , honey , you 're not a total loser .
i said , so i 'm not gonna lose her ?
oh .

guess who 's here . it 's the toughest guy in toy land , ben . a real american hero . i 'm g.i. joe drop the barbi , drop the barbi .

to score the winning touchdown , by the way .
whoa , whoa , whoa , ho , ho , ho , you did not win the game , the touchdown didn  t count , because of the spectacularly illegal , oh and by the way savage nose breaking .

um , there was a geller cup ?
yes , it was the trophy you got if you won the game . but our dad said ,  nobody won that game ,  and he was sick of our fighting , so he took the trophy and threw it in the lake .

well , i  m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day . hey , phoebe listen , you got this all wrong . those trees were born to be christmas trees , their fulfilling their life purpose , by , by making people happy .
really ?

yes . yes , and ah , ah , the trees are happy too , because for most of them , it  s the only chance to see new york .

and after you  ve delivered the drinks , you take the empty tray
gunther , gunther , please , i  ve worked here for two and a half years , i know the empty trays go over there .
what if you put them here .
huh . well , y 'know that  s actually a really good idea , because that way they  ll be closer to the mugs . y 'know what , you should have the other waitresses do that too .
they already do . that  s why they call it the  tray spot . 
gee , i always heard them talk about that , i just always thought that it was a club they went to . oh god , i  m , i  m sorry .
it  s all right . sweetheart .

so , this must be kinda neat for ya , huh ? i mean , your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school , and you , you ah , don  t have to sell those cookies anymore .
well , i kinda wanted to sell the cookies . the girl who sells the most wins a trip to spacecamp , and gets to sit in a real space shuttle .
wow , you ah , you really like all this space stuff , huh ?
yeah . my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments , as i do daydreaming about outer space , he  d be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal .
i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india .
no . the one in atlantic city , dad loves the slots . he says he  s gonna double the college money my grandma left me .
huh . well , good luck to dad . say , how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win ?
the girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five .
yeah .
so far , i  ve sold seventy-five .
four hundred , huh ? well , that sounds do-able . how much are the boxes ?
five dollars a box .
and what is second prize ?
a ten speed bike . but , i  d rather have something my dad couldn  t sell .
well , that makes sense .
could you do me one favor , if it  s not too much trouble ?
yeah , sarah , anything .

all right okay , it was like four years ago . okay , ginger and i had gone out a few times , and then this one weekend , we went up to her dad  s cabin . just me , her , and her annoying little dog pepper . well that night , i cooked this really romantic
you gave her food poisoning ?
i wish . no . after dinner , me , her , and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire . well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out . so , i picked up a log and threw it on . or , at least what

waxine
yes have you seen it ?
oh , it  s incredible i so want to be a waxine girl .
i know
god . do think it really doesn  t hurt ?  cause how can they do that ?
hello organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest
they have the best stuff in there .

oh my god oh my god
yeah . we figured when we couldn  t find you , you  d gone home to make up with rachel . which is probably what you shoulda done . huh ?
you think ? god , i , ah , i  m in hell . i mean what , what am i gonna do ? rachel  s all like ,  i love you and , and let  s work on this .  and all i can think about is ,  what is she gonna do
well , before we answer that , i think we should address the more important question . how dumb are you ?
what ? look , we  re trying to rebuild a relationship here , right . how am i supposed to do that here , without being totally honest with each other ?
look , ross look , i  m on board about this totally honesty thing , i am , just not about stuff that  s gonna get you in trouble .
he  s right . nobody  s gonna benefit , and you  re just gonna hurt her .
yeah , and there won  t be a relationship left to rebuild .
yeah , but don  t you think
all right look , if you absolutely have to tell her , at least wait until the timing  s right . and that  s what deathbeds are for .
yeah , okay .
all right , okay , now , we just have to make sure she doesn  t find out some other way . did you think about the trail ?
what trail ?
the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it you always have to think about the trail
oh , i-i don  t think there  s any trail .
okay , okay-okay , ah , chloe works with that guy issac . issac  s sister is jasmine . and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe . and phoebe  s friends with rachel . and that  s the trail , i did it

after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one ,
did that
grasp one of the linen strips by its  easy grab tab  and pull it off in one quick pain free motion .
okay . ow ow-oh-oh
was it not pain-free ?
no . it was painful . oh my god , they should call it pain-zine , now with a little wax .
huh , well , the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don  t seem to think it  s that bad .
that  s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid . but hey , y 'know if you don  t believe me , please , by my guest .
ow-ow-ow-ow oh my god
now , are you glad we didn  t start with the bikini strips ?

chloe ? hi
is this about me taking your watch ?
you took my watch ?
i  m sorry , i do that .
just you keep it , listen did you , did you tell anyone about us ?
oh no . i feel it isn  t really anybody  s business , y 'know .
exactly . so you didn  t , didn  t mention anything to issac right ?
oh , well i tell issac everything .
you tell , of course you do . issac . issac . hey , issac . issac , hi y 'know we haven  t actually met
you dog
yes , i suppose i am a dog . but issac , see i-i happen to have a girlfriend .
oh right , that rachel chick from the coffee place .
yeah , that  s the one . listen , i don  t want to hurt her .
oh , hey , man i know , doesn  t matter how much we love  em , monogamy is too cruel a rule .
yeah . listen , can you keep this information to yourself ?
aw , no problem dude . y 'know we got to look out for each other . we  re the same , you and me .
actually , no , we  re not .
yeah , we are .
no , we  re not .
yeah , we are .
no , we  re not
okay , we  re not .
right .
but , we are .
fine . i just need to know that you  re not gonna tell your sister .
i can promise not to tell her again .

jasmine ?
uh-huh .
we met at phoebe  s birthday party , i  m , i  m ross geller .
you did a bad thing
yes , i did .
very bad
very bad .
very , very bad .
i  m agreeing with you . did you , listen , did you happen to tell phoebe yet ?
no .
okay , jasmine , please , please don  t . i love my girlfriend very much , and i want more than anything to just work it out with her . okay ?
all right .
thank you , thank you .
but you should probably talk to my roommate , because i told him and he knows phoebe too .
who  s your roommate ?

gunther gunther . gunther , please tell me you didn  t say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place .
i  m sorry . was i not supposed to ?

we  re all right .
it  s okay , it  s okay .
we  re all right .
we were just waxing our legs .
off ?
for your information , this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience .
yeah , well i don  t think you can make that statement , unless you  ve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely .
yeah , i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men , that  s all . i mean , come on , it  s just a little wax .
oh yeah , come here .
oh , that  s mature .
okay , fine , so now what , i just pull it off ?
uh-huh .
that  s right .

come on , rachel , come on talk to me please

i can  t talk to you . i can  t even look at you right now
what ?
nothing , nothing .
rachel said everything was okay .
what , what are they talking about ?
rachel ?

just get away from me
no , it was a mistake i made a mistake okay ?
a mistake ? what were you trying to put it in ? her purse ?

whe-where did he put it ?

ross , you had sex with another woman

oh my god .
oh , i knew something had to be wrong , because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday .

yeah , never cheat on rachel .

i  m sorry , okay , i  m sorry . i wa-i was disgusted with myself , and this morning i was so , i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy , and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible .
whoa whoa , whoa , wait a minute . what time did your little friend leave ? oh my god . she was there ? she was still there ? she was in there , when i was in there ?

listen . oh hey , hey , the important thing was that she meant , she meant nothing to me
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship

look , i didn  t think there was a relationship to jeopardise . i thought we were broken up .
we were on a break
that , for all i knew would , could last forever . that to me is a break-up .
you think you  re gonna get out of this on a technicality ?
look , i  m not trying to get out of anything , okay . i thought our relationship was dead
well , you sure had a hell of a time at the wake

y 'know what , i don  t think we should listen to this anymore .
what , what are you doing ? you can  t go out there .
why not ? i  m hungry .
because they  ll know we  ve been listening .

god and to have to hear about it from gunther
come on like i wanted him to tell you , i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn  t happen
oh , that is so sweet . i think i  m falling in love with you all over again .

y 'know what , i think we can go out there . i mean they have more important things to worry about .
yeah , we  ll be fine .

wax the door shut , we  re never leaving , ever .

hi , it  s phoebe . listen someone  s gonna have to take my 9 00 with mr. rehack ,  cause it  s like 9 15 now , and i  m not there .

all right . let  s say i had slept with mark . would you have been able to forgive me ?
yes i would .
you  d be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me , and been naked with me , and made love to me ?
yes .

anyway her and ross just started yelling at each other .
wait . why was he yelling at her ? he  s the one who slept with someone else .
well , i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened , that she should of forgiven him by now .
whoa he is soo unreasonable god , although i think i understand what he means . oh my god , this is like 60 minutes , okay , when , when , at first you  re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y 'know you just feel bad for the people because they
y 'know what this is like ? this is like when my parents got divorced . man , i hope ross doesn  t try to kidnap me after cub scouts .

oh , is it the swearing ? i mean is it the constant swearing ? because i gotta tell ya , if it is , you can just kiss my ass
no , no . it-it  s not about the swearing , it  s more about ah , the way , that you ah , occasionally , concentrate , your enthusiasm on my buttock .
oh ?
oh , and don  t get me wrong , i appreciate the sentiment . it  s just that i , i have a rather , sensitive posterior , and ah , besides , it  s making all the other guys jealous .
well , say no more . y 'know it takes guts to bring this up . bing you  re okay .
okay .

wow look at that , chip matthews called . i wonder what he wants ?
well ah , actually
i bet he sensed that i was ready to have sex with another guy .

what kind of profit is that ? and you call yourself an accountant .
nooo .
oh . what do you do ?
i can  t believe you don  t know what i do for a living
yeah , i actually don  t know
good , so do i
something to do with numbers ?

oh my god no shoo kitty no no-no-no shoo come on , you come on . crazy . oh my god .
what ?
nothing . nothing .
what ? what  s wrong ?
i just , i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother .
you mean the mom you met in montauk . she was a cat ?
no , no-no , she was a human lady . this is the spirit of my mom lily , the one who killed herself .
are you sure she  s in the cat , or have you been taking your grandma  s glycoma medicine again ?
no dr. skeptismo i  m sure . first of all , okay , there  s the feeling . okay , and for another , how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt . my mother  s favourite fish is orange roughy cats like fish hi , mommy .
dude , phoebe  s mom has got a huge peni
let it go

hey
umm , when were you gonna tell me that you  re going out with chip matthews ?
now ? is it okay if i go out with chip matthews ?
nooo it  s not okay i can  t believe you would want to after what he did to me
what , that little thing at the prom ?
monica i couldn  t find him for two hours he was having sex with amy welch
come on , that was back in high school how could that still bother you ?
i mean why , of all people would you want to go out with chip ?
look , you and i went to different high schools
okay , that doesn  t help me , because we went to the same high school .
you went to one where you were popular , and you got to ride off chip  s motorcycle , and wear his letterman jacket . i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made .
they had to have that specially made ?
it was a project for one of the home ec classes .
oh my god , they told us that was for the mascot
back then , i thought that i would never , ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews , and now he  s-he  s called me up and asked me out . and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go . i-i owe her this . i never let her eat .
oh , you go out with him .
oh , really ?
yeah . just , if it  s possible , could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy ?
i  ll try .

so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center ?
well , there were a couple of calls last night , but ah , i don  t think any of them are gonna work out .
yes , joey has a very careful screening process . apparently , not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails .
stop it stop it she keeps squirming , trying to get away just like when she was alive .
so pheebs , how long is your mom gonna be with us ?
well , i  m not sure . i mean , i guess until she y 'know , gets used to the fact that there  s y 'know , a new mom . y 'know , i think she  s worried that y 'know , she  s gonna , she  s gonna be replaced . well
why can  t you use the phone in here ?
well , i  m returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h . i just spelled the wrong word .
so , guys , am i crazy , or does phoebe  s mom remind anyone of a cat ?
ross , don  t start .
come on , you-you can  t tell me you actually believe that-that there  s a woman inside that cat
i believe it .
no you don  t .
yes , i do .
no you do  y 'know what , you  re not gonna suck me into this .
oh sure i am , because you always have to be right .

pretty nice ?
you  ll have to pardon my roommate , he wanted to marry this .
we don  t have 50 bucks , but would you be willing to trade for it ? we  ve got a canoe .

y 'know , i , i really don  t think we need a canoe .

is that why you bought all this stuff ? well , yknow what i will not watch your tv , i will not listen to your stereo , and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat you know why ?

oh wow , eight hours ? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh ?
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office ?
you shouldnt .
speaking of christmas , umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money , umm , this year maybe we could do secret santa , and then we each only buy one gift . and-and theres the added mystery of who gets who .
who gets whom . i dont know why i do that .

well , im gonna take a nap , turkey makes me sleepy .
we havent eaten yet
i know , but all that work youre doing to get it ready , i just
hey , by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa , cause i wanna trade for her .
i picked her oh thank god you want her ooh
wow why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets , its like impossible to get her something she likes . come on , lets trade
oh thats not true thats not true i got her that backpack and she loved it i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it oh , there was no big dog . all right this sucks i already got her this briefcase , and i had r.g. put on it her
ohh .
well , maybe you could give to somebody else . ooh , like ross geller .

hi yeah , im calling on behalf of monica gellers eye , and is um , is richard burke in today . hes out of town , but does she want to see the on-call doctor ?
yes
yes shes very excited about that .

this is so cool , til monica gets back , its like im head chef and i get to make all the decisions .
hey-hey , i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly
okay , get out of my kitchen
all right okay i think i am making some progress with joey , when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once i mean yeah , he gave me the finger while doing it .
all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question .
so listen ah , i picked monica for secret santa , but im already getting her something for chanukah , i was wondering if you wanna switch .
oh yknow what , i was already trying to trade for ah , well , you .
really ? wow thats-thats so nice , what are you gonna get me ?
i dont know r.g. , i was thinking something girlie for your office .
yeah , well maybe phoebe will switch with me .
oh no-no-no , you dont want to do that , then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets .
oh , thats not true ive got her lots of stuff she never took back .
like ?
like uh , that gold necklace i got her last year .
when was the last time you saw her wear it ?
well , she wore it all christmas day , and then uh
big dog ?

hey
hey
what are you doing ?
im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .
everything ? even the tv ?
no im putting that in my room .
listen , joey , i know what he did was wrong but dont you think you could at least hear the guy out ?
back when you and rachel were together , if chandler had kissed her , would you hear him out ?
thats a good point . so uh , how long are you gonna punish him ?
five years .
youve sentenced him ?
hey dont do the crime if you cant do the time .
joey , the guys your best friend .
no , was my best friend . anyway , i dont know why youre pushing for him so hard . with him out of the way as my best friend , theres a spot open .
oh , who ? me ?
yeah
wow im honored and yknow what im gonna do as my first act as your best friend ?
what ?
im gonna get you to talk to chandler .
all right . but if you werent my best friend .

oh my god , is it really that bad ?
i walk into a room and he wont even talk to me , he just mumbles something in italian . and i know he only knows the bad words .
hey gunther , have you uh , have you seen chandler ?
i thought you were chandler . but umm , one of who is over there .

oh .

dr. burke will see you know .
oh no-no-no , not dr. burke . dr. burke is out of town . the-the on-call doctor will see me now .
dr. richard burke is out of town . dr. timothy burke , his son , will see you now .
ready ?

hey im sorry that where are you going ?
my folks .
oh , uh , when-when are you coming back ?
i dont know . i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .
what ?
yeah , yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow , work it out , but uh , seeing you two together i dont think i
hey , look , what do you want me to say ? do you want me to say that ill stop seeing her ?
look , its not about her . okay ? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did . and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend . so , ill see ya .
hey , look , i know what it is to be a friend , i just-i just screwed up
yeah you did and thats why im leaving .

all right look , if youre not gonna stay for me , then at least stay for them okay , they have had a very difficult year what with the robbery and all
when that guy was robbing us , and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours , you know what i was doing in there all that time ? i was thinking about how i let you down
what ?
yeah but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be , i wouldnt have worried about it so much see you around
all right , wait come on just wait one second there has to be something that i can do something if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down . what ?
weve got a box .

last time i saw you , it was the morning i left for college . and you were just standing outside the dairy queen .
i was probably waiting for it to open .
i gotta tell you , you look great now .
you look great too .
youre an excellent patient
so how does it look ?
well , youve got a little scratch on your cornea , your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days .
like a pirate ?
if that helps you .
umm , so how long have you been working with your dad ? come on , one of us had to mention him .
i moved back here a couple of months ago .
oh . big family dinner tonight ?
uh .
no way
i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriends .
oh .
but we broke up .
oh .
she-she wasnt ready for a serious commitment .
oh . so you made her walk the plank ? aye , matie ?
youre not wearing the patch yet .
i know .

hes coming here for thanksgiving
i know , its sick .
why is it sick ?
because its richards son its like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner
hey , come on , phoebe , you understand dont you ?
yeah , i can see where id be your best shot but , no . im sorry , but i think its twisted .
yeah .
whats twisted ?
me going out with richards son .
ewwwww ew ew ew
sounds like a really bad idea to me .
is he okay in there ?
hes fine
hey , y 'know , mon , if things wrong out between you and richards son , youd be able to tell your kids , that you slept with their grandfather .
fine judge all you want to but , married a lesbian , left a man at the altar , fell in love with a gay ice dancer , threw a girls wooden leg in a fire , livin in a box
so now , what exactly is the point of the box ?
chandler ?
the meaning of the box is three fold . one , it gives me the time to think about what i did . two , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey . and three , it hurts
oh hey hey uh , you remember the necklace i gave you last year ? can i see it ?
why ?
i just wanna check something .
okay .
now , well see .
air hole air hole
here it is i love it . i wear it all the time .

hey
hey
hey
ooh how was kathys play ?
well , kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy .
yeah , its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $ 32 to see it
thats a good idea for a business
im totally screwed . okay , they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night , and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me . y 'know itll be like , so wheres your boyfriend , whats-his-name , chester ? and shell go , no-no-no , its chandler . and
that-that is a good trick .
all right , look , look , what am i gonna do ?
chandler , look theyre actors . theyre there to do a job , just cause they work together , doesnt mean theyre gonna get together . i mean just cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins , it doesnt mean its gonna happen with them .
oh-oh , alec baldwin and kim basinger .
tom cruise and nicole kidman .
yeah .
hey , mel gibson and clint eastwood .
theyre not a couple
oh-okay , i get the game now .
okay look , look , let me ask you a question , when they were doing it on stage , was it like really hot ?
oh yeah
well okay , so then youre fine . the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone . okay ? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about . its when the heat goes away , thats when youre in trouble .
really ?
look , you guys have been to every play ive ever been in , have i ever had chemistry on stage ?
no .
noooo

so uh , man , are you gonna go to the play with me tonight ?

and why do you care so much ?
because you could get to live out my fantasy
you had fantasies about emily ?
no yknow , the fantasy meet someone from a strange land , fall in madly love , and spend the rest of your lives together .
is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that ukrainian kid ?

yes
yeah , he likes porn .

where ya going ?
im going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny . hey , pheebs
hey .
hey
how did it go with frank and alice ?

yeah , what were you trying to get her to do ?
what do i do now ?
you play hard to get .
she already lives in london .
then you go to tokyo .
all right look , forget it , forget it . you told her you love her , its over .
it is not over youre over
what ?
you know
okay . good one .
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you . and the reason why she couldnt , is because her feelings were so strong , it scared her . now you go home and wait for her call , she could be calling you from the plane come on now go go
okay okay but if she doesnt call , it is definitely over no , wait . wait . unless , eventually , i call her , yknow just to she whats going on , and , and she says shell call me back , but then she doesnt . then its over .

way to be strong , man

well

you put your fist through the wall ?
no , i missed and hit the door . but , it opened really hard
you have to go to london
what ?
yeah , you have to go fight for her
oh yeah , sure , that makes sense . yeah . cause you already told her you love her and she didnt say it back , then she called you and told you that theres another guy , so yeah , go to london thatll scare her
when rachel was with paulo , what did you do ?
i made fun of his accent .
you sat back and let him have her , you didnt fight at all . am i right ? do you want the same thing to happen with emily ?

hi , guys .
hi phoebe .
hi phoebe .
i-i wanted to apologise if iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower . yknow its just the hormones , yknow .

hormones .
hormones , yeah .
anyway , i just wanted to say thank you , it was just , it was so sweet .
wow , you seem to be doing so much better . thats great . so how-how are things going ?
good . yknowno-no , okay , its-it feels like everythings been about me lately , so whats happening with you ?
oh , well , actually we were just talking about me not going to rosss wedding .
oh
it just might be too hard , given the history and all that
wow this reminds me of the time when i was umm , living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him .
well , h-how is this like that ?
well , lets see , its not . really , like that . because , you see that was an actual problem , and uh , yours is just like yknow a bunch of yknow high school crap that nobody really gives yknow
im-im sorry , i just thought that
alrighty , here come the water works .

ugh i dont know what im going to do i called the company that sent and th-they dont care then i called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me , if this isnt an emergency , then what is ?
hey guys
hey
hey
i just wanted to thank you again for last night , what a great party and the guys from work had a blast . yknow , one of them had never been to a bachelor party before . yeah and-and another one had never been to a party before , so
so uh , hey , that uh , that wedding ring , huh ? man , thats nice
yeah , right
i was uh , i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself , i might want to get one of those
that ring ? when my grandmother first came to this country , that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her .
so you might say , the ring is irreplaceable ?
oh absolutely it has been in my family for generations , and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life .
so you might say , its a magic ring .
yeah , the stripper stole it .
my-my ring ? my-my wedding ring ? the-the stripper stole my wedding ring ? h-how ? how could this all happen ?
well , i think it all started when you said , hey joey , why dont you be my best man .
all right-all right , fine i-im gonna call the cops
dude , i screwed up , you dont have to turn me in
not on you on the stripper
oh , yeah , well i already did that they said theyre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders .
okay , well , well call the company that sent her
i did that too they wouldnt give me her real name or her number . they said , if i bothered them again theyd call the police . i said , if you talk to the police , you tell them im missing a ring
so what , joey ? wh-wh-what ? what are you telling me ? that theres nothing we can do ? well , how could this happen ?
look ross , i am so-so sorry . i-i-i
well , what if we just ah , called her , used a fake name , and had her come to my office ?
oh , that sounds like fun , but weve got a ring to find

so-so , what do you want for lunch ?
oh , i don  t know . i guess we have to eat .
yeah , i do . what  s the matter ?
i  m just bummed about the way i left things with ross . i shouldn  t have lied to him about having to work . he seemed so mad at me .
eh , don  t be so hard on yourself . if someone i was still in love with was getting married
still in love with ?
yeah
i  m not in love with ross
oh . no . no . good yeah , me neither .
phoebe , i  m going to ross  s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable . not because , i  m still in love with him i mean , hey , y  know , i like ross as much as the next guy , y  know ? clearly i have
we thought you knew
we ?
yeah , we all know we talk about it all the time
you all know ? does ross know ?
oh no , ross doesn  t know anything .
oh , i can not believe you didn  t tell me
well , because we thought you knew it  s so obvious god , that would be like telling monica , hey , you like things clean .

hey
so , what are you guys in the market for ? we  ve got uh , scarves , tulip post cards
check this out ? huh ? yeah . that  s the stuff . what do you think ?
well , i don  t have to buy that , i  m with stupid t-shirt anymore .
well , i like it . here you go .
all right , look , you  re not really gonna buy that are you ? don  t you think you  ve embarrassed me enough for one day ?
oh , i embarrass you ?
how can i answer that when i  m pretending i don  t know you ?
he  s just jealous . you  ll fit right in all londoners wear them
oh really ? then how come no one here is wearing them ?
they  re all tourists .
all right , look , if you insist on wearing that , in public , y  know , you  re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself .
oh yeah ? if you  re gonna make me choose between you and the hat ? i choose the hat .
good choice .
thanks .
okay , wait . all right , that  s it , okay , i  m out of here . i am not going to be embarrassed anymore

hello ?
hey i just spoke to your dad , and you know what ? he seems to think we  ll be able to find a new place for the wedding .
we don  t have to .
whoa-whoa-what ? you found a place ?
no . but , monica and i were talking , and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down , and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit .
she said what ?
she said , if i  m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day , well then we should just postpone it .
postpone it ? emily , do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ? do you my sister  s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here , huh ? this isn  t right .
i realize that people are going to be disappointed . but , i  m sure they  ll come back when we can do it right .
i can  t ask people to do that ? would you ask people to do that ?
don  t you point your pants at me we have no choice anywhere that  s half-decent would  ve be booked months ago , ross don  t you understand ? this is our wedding i  m talking about .
the only thing i understand is postponing it is not an option . this is when we  re getting married .
so what are you saying ? it  s now or never ?
no . i  m saying it  s now .
or ?
there  s no  or  in mind . what is wrong with these pants ?
it  s not the pants . it  s you that is backwards . and if , and if you don  t understand how important this is to me , well then , perhaps we shouldn  t get married at all
no , wait emily no , wait , stop emily , please 

hey
hi .
so , did shopping make you feel any better about ross ?
manhattan does not have enough stores .
well , i think i can help you get over him .
you can ?
yeah . i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .
um-hmm .
and a small piece of chocolate .
okay .
and a glass of tepid water .
ooh , is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree ?
uh , only if you have the hiccups too . yeah , the pictures are for you , the water and the chocolate is for me . i just didn  t feel like getting up . okay , i  m gonna show you a picture of ross . okay ? and you  re going to remember all
i can do that . i certainly did it when we were going out .
okay . umm , before we get started , i just wanna say for the record that i love ross , i think he  s such a great guy . here . okay , now , close your eyes . and imagine that you  re with ross okay and imagine that you  re kissing him . and
i don  t know , his uh , his hair never really bothered me that much , and y  know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy .
okay , this is going to be harder than i thought . umm , let  s try some uh , aversion therapy .
okay .
okay ?
all right .
so uh , now look at the picture
okay .
all right , and umm
ow
okay , how do you feel now ?
well , i like you less

hey-hey , since you  re the  fix-it  lady , here  s a pickle , what do you do when the bride says she doesn  t want to have the wedding at all ?
she said that ?
yeah .
why ?
i don  t know , i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .
oh my god . you  re even dumber than i am
excuse me ?
ross , how long have you been planning this wedding ?
i don  t know . a month ?
emily has probably been planning it since she was five ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head . that  s what we did we dreamed about the perfect wedding , and the perfect place , with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top
i had no idea . and that-that pillowcase thing , i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .
sometimes we were .
come on . you gotta help me figure out what to do . okay ?
okay .
come on .
that was pretty intense huh ?
yeah . hey , i hope ross didn  t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here
i hope he did

it 's very weird i don 't want some guy down there telling me , i 'm y 'know , dilatedamundo
to be fair , he doesnt seem to be impersonating fonzie
what are you doing ? why are you defending him ? just get me another doctor one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie

umm , listen there 's something i think you should know .
oh , is this about you-you dating the nurse ? yeah , joey already told me , and i am so-so fine . i mean , you and i we 're just , y 'know , we 're nothing , we 're goofin around .

phoebe , no this is , this is insane .
oh , just ask him
me ?
i can 't ask him do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be ? all i 'm saying is just talk to frank . okay ? just , y 'know , feel him out
no forget it i am not gonna ask frank to give you one of his kids
you 're right .

tell him it 's for you .

feeling a little better sweetie ?
well , maybe a little . i wish you hadn 't seen me throw up .
me too .
hey i just heard . what 's up ?
kidney stones now , ordinarily mr. tribbiani , we try to break up the stones up with shock waves , but they 're to close to the bladder now . which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
whoa-whoa no-no-no-no-no , nothing is going up okay ? up , up is not an optionwhat 's a urethra ? are you crazy ?

so did you ask him ?
no , i haven 't had a chance to be alone with him yet .

a little uh , good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure , now that 's the kind of math joey likes to do
ugh , pbs
what 's wrong with pbs ?
ugh , what 's right with them ?
why dont you like pbs , pheebs ?
okay , cause right after my mom killed herself , i was just in this really bad place , y 'know personally . so , i just thought that it 'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street , cause they were so nice when i was a little kid no one ever wrote back .
well y 'know a lot of those muppets don 't have thumbs .
all i got was a lousy key chain and by that time i was living in a box . i didn 't have keys
i 'm sorry pheebs , i just , y 'know , i just wanted to do a good deed . like-like you did with the babies .
this isn 't a good deed , you just wanted to get on tv this is totally selfish .
whoa whoa whoa what about you , having those babies for your brother ? talk about selfish
what-what are you talking about ?
well , yeah , it was a really nice thing and all , but it made you feel really good right ?
yeah . so ?
it made you feel good , so that makes it selfish . look , there 's no unselfish good deeds , sorry .
yes there are there are totally good deeds that are selfless .
well , may i ask for one example ?
yeah , it 's y 'know there 'sno you may not

that 's because all people are selfish .
are you calling me selfish ?
are you calling you people ? yeah , well sorry to burst that bubble , pheebs , but selfless good deeds don 't exist . okay ? and you the deal on santa clause right ?
i 'm gonna find a selfless good dead . i 'm gonna beat you , you evil genius .

hello .
hello , ross ?
emily ? emily oh my god oh my god , it 's emily it 's emily everyone shush-shush-shhst hi
ross , i 'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives . good-bye
no wait look , wait okay , you can hang up , but i 'm gonna keep calling i 'm gonna , i 'm gonna call everyone in england if that 's what it takes to get you to talk to me
really ? about what ?
look you 're my wife . we 're-we 're married . y 'know ? i-i love you . i-i really miss you .
i miss you to . well , at least i think i do .
she 's talking .
yay
hey , joey , when you said the deal with santa clause , you meant ?
that he doesn 't exist .
right .

so chandler , have you heard about monica 's secret boyfriend ?
uhh , yeah . she uh , she uh , she uh might 've mentioned him .
so mon , when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man ?
ohh , he 's really shy . i-i dont think he 's up to meeting everyone yet .
yeah , i don 't think he 's up to meeting everyone yet .
i dont care i wanna meet this guy who 's the best sex she ever had

really ? that 's what you heard ? you said that ?
i might 've said that . why is that funny ?
because i 'm very happy for him and you , you lucky dog
hi
hey
well , emily 's willing to work on the relationship .
yes
that 's great
in london
what ?
she wants me to move to london .
but you live here you know that .
what-what-what are you gonna do ?
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben .
yeah , i 'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife .
it could happen .

how ya doin ? welcome . good to see ya
this will be your phone .
that 's great . but uh , i 'm not really expecting a lot of calls .
no you answer it and take pledges .
but i 'm the host
no , gary collins is the host . you 'll be answering the phones .
you don 't seem to understand . see , i was dr. drake remoray .
well , here 's your phone doctor .

i cannot believe i can 't find a selfless good deed y 'know that old guy that lives next to me ? well , i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop . but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies . then i felt wonderful . that old jackass
maybe joey 's right . maybe all good deeds are selfish .
i will find a selfless good deed cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right
hey , monica ? can i ask you a cooking question ?
sure
if you 're cooking on the stove , does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?
chandler is he ?
well , y 'know i-i-i think i 'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend .
why ? i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you 'd ever had , i 'd be going like this .

all right emily , as much as i love you , i 'm sorry , i can 't move to london without ben .
i understand that would be difficult .
yeah , would you please consider moving here ? i mean you were gonna move here anyway , why can 't you just do that ?
i don 't know , it 's just
oh-oh-okay , but-but i know , that even though i 've been a-a complete idiot up til now , i mean , i mean you-you-you have to come here . you have to come here so we can work this out .
all right .
all right , did you just say all right ?
i did . now i 'm the idiot .
oh , emily that is , that is so great . it 's gonna be so great we 're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love

ross , there 's one thing that really scares me still .
yes , tell me .
well , you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family , all my friends .
i know . i am , i am so sorry .
and then after decided to forgive you , seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her .
again , very sorry .
i mean , i can 't-i can 't be in the same room as her it drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her
emily , there is nothing between rachel and me . okay ? i love you .
all right . i 'll come to new york and we 'll try and make this work .
oh that is so great that 's
as long as you don 't see rachel anymore .

so i asked emily if she would come to new york , and she said yes .
yes
ooh-ohh
great
no-no-no only if i promise never to see rachel again .
why ?
what ? you can 'twhat did you tell her ?
i told her i 'd have to think about it . i mean , how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision ? i 'm actually asking you
well , you can 't just not see rachel anymore , she 's one of your best friends .
yeah but , he can 't not exactly see emily , i mean that 's his wife .
yeah .
that 's true
yeah , but you 've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life .
that 's true
no , you cannot .
thanks for the help , problem solved .

hello .

ohh , i 've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey
okay , y 'know your not though . let 's go .
wait what about joey ?

hey , guess what i 'm doing this weekend i 'm going to this culinary fair in new jersey .
oh weird , chandler just told us he 's got a conference there
oh now that-that-that 's funny , it seems like chandler 's conference could 've been in connecticut or vermont .
i 'm not in charge of where the conference is held . do you want people to think it 's a fake conference ? it 's a real conference .
hey .
hey
hey .
is rachel here ? i gotta talk to her .
no , she 's out shopping .
damn
what 's going on ?
i told emily to come . and i just need to y 'know , talk to rachel about it .
wait a minute so when emily comes you 're just , you 're not gonna see rachel anymore ?
well look , i 'm just trying to focus on the i get to see my wife , part , all right ? and not the part that makes me do this .
wow , so you guys are , you 're never gonna be in the same room together ? how is that even gonna work ?
i have no idea . i mean but-but i assure you i will figure it out .

doesnt seem like it 's going to work , i mean
hi , guys
hi
uh , hey
what 's going on ?
we 're flipping monica 's mattress .
so i 'm thinking , basically we pick it up and then we flip it .
yeah that 's better than my way .

oh okay , hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
aww , man
oh look a letter from my mom .
so , rach , y 'know-y 'know how emily 's coming right ?
oh yeah i know .

can you hear anything ?
oh yes , somebody just said , can you hear anything ?

hey , joey 's ass what are you doing ?
well , remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ? well , when ross said rachel at the wedding , i figured it was gonna happen again , so i hid this in here .
ooh , candy bars , crossword puzzles
ooh , madlibs , mine
condoms ?
you don 't know how long we 're gonna be in here we may have to repopulate the earth .
and condoms are the way to do that ?

anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this , the last time i talked to emily
oh my god my dog died
what ?
oh my god , le poo , our dog
le poo 's still alive ?
oh god , it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine- -teen blocks . oh . oh my god .
sweetie , we heard you crying . please don 't cry .
it 's le poo .
i know it 's le poo right now , but it 'll get better .

i can 't believe it we 're here
ooh , chocolates on the pillows i love that
oh , you should live with joey , roll-os everywhere .
come here . okay , be right back .

oh yes monica , get in here there 's a high-speed car chase on

we 're switching rooms .

yeah , i know . it 's ridiculous i can 't see you either .

i think you 'll find this room more to your liking .
okay , great .
they say he 's only got half a tank left .
half a tank ? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do
we 're switching rooms again .
what ? why ?
this is a garden view room , and we paid for an ocean view room .
our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you .
excuse me , umm , can i talk to you over here for just a second ?
uh-huh .
chandler
yeah .
look , these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i 'm not gonna let em and we 're not a couple of suckers

okay , this one i like
nothing it 's over dammit this is regularly scheduled programming
can we turn the tv off ? okay ? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this ?
oh , i 'm sorry , am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun ?
hey , don 't blame me for wigging tonight
oh , who should i blame ? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms ?
i don 't know , how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas

okay , what 's up ?
okay , y 'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?
yeah , i told you to give emily whatever she wants .
and while that was good advice , you should know that what-what she wants
yeah ?
is for me not to see you anymore .
that 's crazy you can 't do that what are you going to tell her ? oh god . ohh , you already agreed to this , haven 't you ?
it 's awful i know , i mean , i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work . and i do , i have to make this marriage work . i have too . but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here .
ohh lucky me oh my god that is good news , ross i think that 's the best news i 've heard since le poo died
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been . this is so hard .
oh yeah , really ? is it ross ? yeah ? okay , well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you .
what are you doing ?
storming out
rachel , this is your apartment .
yeah , well that 's how mad i am

hi
hey , you 're back too
yeah . umm , chandler can i talk to you outside for a second ?
hey , how was your chef thing ?
oh , it was awful . i guess some people just don 't appreciate really good food .
well , maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea .
chandler
monica .

okay , i 'd like to know how much the room was because i 'd like to pay my half .
okay , fine , $ 300 .
300 dollars ?
yeah , just think of it as $ 25 per room
urghh
what are you guys woofing about ?
chandler stole a twenty from my purse
nooooo y 'know what ? now that i think about it , i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots

you should 've seen the look on her face . i don 't want rachel to hate me i don 't know what to do .
you want my advice ?
yes please
you 're not gonna like it .
that 's okay .
you got married to fast .
that 's not advice
i told ya .
i 'm going to the bathroom .

yeah , me either .
maybe i could do it .
hi
hi , rach .
hi
hey .
hey .
look , i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y 'know , i 've been obsessing about it all day and i 'd just love not to talk about it . all right ?
i-i-i don 't know if this falls under this category , but uh , ross is right back there .
that 's not ross
oh no not that guy he does look like him though .
okay , ross is in the bathroom .
oh my god , its happening . it 's already started . i 'm kip .
hey , you 're not kip
do you even know who kip is ?
who cares ? you 're rachel who 's kip ?
kip , my old roommate , y 'know we all used to hang out together .
oh , that poor bastard .
see ? yeah , you told me the story . he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn 't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened ? he got phased out
you 're not gonna be phased out
well , of course i am it 's not gonna happen to ross he 's your brother . he 's your old college roommate . ugh , it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group . i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go .
ehh
honey , come on you live far away you 're not related . you lift right out .

hey
hey , mr. bing . that uh , hotel you stayed at called . said someone left an eyelash curler in your room .
yes that was mine .
'cause i figured you 'd hooked up with some girl and she 'd left it there .
yes that would have made more sense .
y 'know , i-i don 't even feel like i know you anymore man all right , look , i 'm just gonna ask you this one time . and whatever you say , i 'll believe ya . were you , or were you not on a gay cruise ?

phoebe ? i 'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing . you gotta come with me
come where ?
wherever i go . come on you and me , we 'll-we 'll start a new group , we 're the best ones .
okay , but try and get joey too .
pheebs , you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec ?
oh , sure bye ross forever .
hi .
hi . what are you doing here ? isn 't this against the rules ?
i talked to monica , look , i 'm the one who made the choice . i 'm the one who 's making things change , so i should be the one to y 'know , step back .
oh , ross
no , no , it 's okay . really . they 're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king . so is , is that better ?
no , it 's not better . i still don 't get to see you .
well , what-what would you do ? rach , if you were me , what-what would you do ?
well , for starters i would 've said the right name at my wedding
i can 't believe this is happening .
i know .
i am so sorry .
i know that too .
hey , rach ? sorry to interrupt but umm , phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something .

i just came over to drop offnothing . so that weekend kinda sucked , huh ?
yeah , it did .
so , i guess this is over .
what ?
well , y 'know , you and me , it had to end sometime .
why , exactly ?
because of the weekend , we had a fight .
chandler that 's crazy if you give up every time you 'd have a fight with someone you 'd never be with anyone longer thanohhh
so , this isn 't over ?
you are so cute no . no , it was a fight . you deal with it and move on it 's nothing to freak out about .
really ? okay . great
ohh , welcome to an adult relationship

oohh ohh oh-oh-oh oh-oh

ohhhhhhhhhhh
yes . yes .
you ? and-and you ?
yes , but you cannot tell anyone no one knows
how ? when ?
it happened in london .
in london
the reason we didn 't tell anyone was because we didn 't want to make a big deal out of it .
but it is a big deal i have to tell someone

no-no-no-no-no you can 't
please ? please ? we just don 't want to deal with telling everyone , okay ? just promise you won 't tell .

all right man , this is unbelievable i mean , it 's great , but
i know , it 's great

aww , i don 't want to see that

we 're so stupid do you know what 's going on in there ? they 're trying to take joey

the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe . and if you win , you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say , hi , phoebe
oh that 's cute we really all enjoyed it . but y 'know , it doesn 't count .
count for what ?
count in our heads as-as good madlibs .

i guess i 'm done .
fun 's over
wait-wait , guys if-if we follow the rules , it 's still fun and it means something
uh-huh
i think i 'm gonna take-off .
guys , rules are good rules help control the fun ohhh

hey hey hey hey none of that , not while you 're living under my roof
what ?
look , just because i know about you two , doesn 't mean i like looking at it .
aren 't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour ?
well , i 'm sorry if i 'm not a middle-aged black woman and i 'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition okay , look , if i have to pretend i don 't know about you two , then you two are gonna have to pretend there 's nothing to know about .
okay .
sorry .
sorry .

i can hear that
rachel 's at work .

i can still hear you

hey
hey
hello
hey , what 's that ?
yeah , my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother . can you believe it ? a year ago i didn 't even have a family , and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud .

eeeee- -ohh god
argh-argh ooh , soft . is this mink ?
yeah why would my mother send me a fur ? doesn 't she know me but at all plus , i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make
yeah , just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour . that didn 't happen , i made that up
hey
oh , ross ? ross you can 't put up flyers in here .
how come ? everybody else does .
you can 't .
what is that ?
oh , umm , i 'm just getting rid of a couple of things .
this is all of your things .
yes , yes it is no , but it 's good it 'semily thinks we should get all new stuff . stuff that 's just ours , together . y 'know brand new .
so basically , this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale .
touched . used . sat on . sleep on .
i 'll take it all .
hey , ross , you 're okay with that ?
look , if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york , i 'm sure everything will be fine .
okay , but don 't you think this is a little extreme ?
after what i did ? can you blame her ?
oh my god you got off easy when my friend silvie 's husband said someone else 's name in bed , she cursed him and turned his thingy green .

what is he doing ? what , emily , thinks ross 's furniture has got rachel coodies ?
now calm down joey .
no everything 's gettin all messed up , y 'know ? emily won 't let ross see rachel , we 're not gonna stop seeing rachel , hence ross stops seeing us
oh , i hate this . everything 's changing .
yeah i know , we 're losing ross , joey said hence
look , i 'm not happy about this either , but y 'know if-if ross says he 's happy then we 're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves . are you cool with that ?
no but y 'know , i 'm an actor , i 'll act cool .

ohh , whoa god storage rooms give me the creeps monica , come on please hurry up honey please ?
rachel , if you want the little round waffles , you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron .
i want the little round waffles .
all right . op , here it is right underneath the can of-of bug bomb . i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison ?

okay , y 'know what ? i 'll-i 'll have toast

arghhhh

oh my god fog him fog him

i don 't know what i 'm gonna do about this coat .
i 'll take it
that might work
ooh-ooh-ooh , yeah enh ? all right , what do you think ?
you 're on in 5 ms. minnelli .
no-no-no , it 's just a bit sudden . no , it 's great . okay ? i 'm totally on board . i love you too , all righty . bye .
what 's the matter ross ?
nothing . oh , actually , great news i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i 'm moving to a new apartment . woo-hoo
why ?
well , her thought is , and i agree , fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ? her cousin has this great place to sublet , it 's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .
that 's way uptown that 's like three trains away which is great i love to ride that rail
so you 're really okay with this ?
yes yes i mean it 's-it 's kinda far from work , but uh , y 'know , i 'll get so much done on the commute . i-i 've been given the gift of time
now that 's so funny , because last christmas i got the gift of space . we should get them together and make a continuum .

now he 's movin ? man , what is emily doing to him ? ow he 's not even here

you guys you guys
we were , we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man
it was like this crazy-eyed , hairy beast man he was like a , like a bigfoot or a yeti or something
and he came at us with an axe , so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him
yeah , i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass
uhh , like dark hair , bushy beard ?
yeah
yeah , you fogged danny .
please we did not fog danny who 's danny ?
dan just moved in downstairs . yeah , he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes . nice fella .
oh he 's nice . he 's nice y 'know , you always stick up for the people we fog

yeah ?
hi you might not remember us , but we are the girls that fogged you .
we 're-we 're really sorry we fogged you .
okay .

hi just so you know , we-we didn 't mean to fog you , we thought you were like a yeti or something .
okay .

yesss ?
hi sorry to bother you , but i don 't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology , it just doesn 't really seem like you mean it .
yeah .
o-kay

wow that guy is so rude
really what is with that guy ? i mean you 'd forgive me if i fogged you .
well you did a little bit .
oh my god , honey , i 'm so sorry
i totally forgive you
really ?
yes

hey
hey
so listen , you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium ?
crematorium chris ? sure
he says , that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm , y 'know , bring in the next person i know who dies .

oh my god oh my god , look at these pelts
don 't get too attached , she 's having it cremated .
what ? uhh , phoebe , honey , honey , i know you 're quirky and i get a big kick out of it , we all do actually , but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature not nature , fashion
this is fashion ? okay , so to you , death is fashion ? that 's really funny . here 's phoebe umm , sporting uh , y 'know , cutting edge hairy carcass from y 'know , the steal traps of wintry russia . i mean , you really thing this looks good ? cause i do .

i know i miss you too . i can 't wait to see you . i love you . bye .
okay , what is in here ? rocks ?
no-no , this is my collection of fossil samples .
so , rocks .

i 'm really gonna miss this apartment . y 'know , ben-ben took his first steps right over there .
ohh . hey , remember when i ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little ?
i loved this place to tell you the truth , i wish i didn 't have to move .
uhh , are you saying that you 're not entirely happy about this ?
well , i mean if uh , if emily gave me a choice
you do have a choice ross , why are you listening to her ? are you , are you crazy ?
why ?
it 's not right what emily wants you to do she is totally- -owww stop pinching me look , now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy , right ? well he just told me that he 's not entirely happy .
what 's going on ?
we all hate emily
nooo
no , ross , we do not hate emily . we-we just , we just think that you 're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy .
yeah
look , we just think that maybe she 's being a little unreasonable .
yes yes unreasonable
unreasonable ? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work all right , it 's about compromise do you always like it ? no do you do it ? yes because it 's not all laughing , happy , candy in the sky
i think he 's right . you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much .

god , i feel so guilty about ross .
oh , i know .
i kinda feel like it 's my fault .

kind of ? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would 've happened .
well , i 'm keeping so many things to myself these days , something was bound to slip out
well , i think it 's very brave what you said .

all right , i can 't sit here anymore . i have to walk places .
pheebs , what are you doing with the coat ? how about the whole animal rights thing ?
well , i 've been reading up and for your information , minks are not very nice . okay , i admit it i love this coat okay , iit 's the best thing i 've ever had wrapped around me , including phil huntley remember phil huntley ? he was fine

hi
so you like the short hair better .
what ? yetii mean danny ?
i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh , fogger smell .
oh . listen , i 'm so sorry . i would , i would 've never fogged you if y 'know if you hadn 't looked so . y 'know .
absolutely . some people are just into appearances .
what ?
that 's cool . cool .
what ? hey no-no-no this not cool you don 't even know me
come on , you got the shopping bags and the sack 's catalog .
so from that you think you 've got me all figured out ? well , you don 't y 'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here
do you ?
well , y 'know , if-if kids like to play with capri pants .
okay .
and stop saying that i hate that
okay

fine i judged you . i made a snap judgement . but you did it too and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement you can 't even open up your mind for a second to see if you 're wrong what does that say about you ?
the pizza-place across the street any good ?
what ?
i 'm hungry . wanna get some pizza ? you can keep yelling if there 's more .
okay . okay .
stop saying that . i hate that .

uh , ross ?
are you still mad at us ?

that 's sweet , joey .
yeah , the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick 's skirt right up . oh which reminds me , i 'm also thankful for thongs .

i mean , it 's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering . i mean , it 's amazing how much they can do with so little material and the way they play with your mind is it there ? is it not there ?
are you aware that you 're still talking ?
is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong ?
huh , i don 't know what to pick . am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction ? hmm .
wow see , and i didn 't think you 'd be able to come up with anything .
i 'm sorry . it 's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever .
no-no-no i am the king of bad thanksgivings . you can 't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me .
oh , you 're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you ?
oh god , no .
oh , come on i wanna hear it it wouldn 't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out
it 's a tradition , like the parade . if the parade decided it was gay , moved out , and abandoned its entire family .

thanksgiving 1978

okay , first of all , if you keep calling it that , no one 's gonna ever take it . then , second of all you 're not actually gonna have sex with him you 're just gonna make him think that you are .
yeah .
yeah .
and when he 's naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him
then , you will definitely get him back
okay , so how do i make him think i wanna have sex with him ?
okay , oh , here 's what you do . just act like everything around you turns you on .
what do you mean ?
well , like anything can be sexy . like umm , oh-oh , like this dishtowel ooh , ooh , this feels sooo good against my cheek and-and if i feel a little hot , i can just dab myself with it . or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i
i can do that

we 'll try to be more careful okay ? it 's just that , we don 't want everyone to know because this is going really well , and maybe the reason it 's going really well is because it 's a secret .

okay .
yeah okayooh , but are you going to have time to read it ?
oh , i read that in high school .
this is going to be so much fun okay-shhh , i have to finish .
hi .
what 's wrong buddy ?
someone at work ate my sandwich
well , what did the police say ?
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich . i can 't believe someone ate it
ross , it 's just a sandwich
just a sandwich ? look , i am 30 years old , i 'm about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life someone ate the only good thing going on in my life
okay , look , i-i have enough stuff for one more sandwich , i mean i was going to eat it myself , but
that-that would be incredible . thank you so much . i-i still can 't believe someone ate it i mean , look , i left a note and everything .

knock-knock . who 's there ? ross geller 's lunch . ross geller 's lunch , who ? ross geller 's lunch , please don 't take me . okay ?
i 'm surprised you didn 't go home wearing your lunch .
okay , look you wanna hold onto your food ? you gotta scare people off . i learned that living on the street .
really ? so what would you say pheebs ? stuff like uh , keep your mitts off my grub ?
say ross , when you picture phoebe living on the street , is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie ?
okay , this will keep them away from your stuff .
whoa ohh
phoebe , you are a bad ass
someday i 'll , tell you about the time i stabbed the cop .
phoebe ?
well , he stabbed me first

sorry i 'm late , but i left late .
okay .
so pheebs , what is the book about ?
i thought you said you read it in high school .
well yeah , but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was , i was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm , what is this book about ?
okay , umm , it 's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm , it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england . which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff 's character . i totally get symbolism .
how would you characterize the theme of this book , uh let 's see here , rachel green ?
umm , well i would have to say that it 's a , it 's tragic love story .
well , that 's sort of a given , but yes . anyone else ?
oh-oh-oh , symbolism and uh , the-the uh , wildness of the mores , which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff 's character .
excellent what rachel has shrewdly observed here
you completely stole my answer
well , honey that was pretty obvious .
well how would you know ? you didn 't even read it
what do you think ? you in the blue shirt .
i think that uh , yours is a question with many answers .
would ya care to venture one ?
would you care to venture one ?
are you just repeating what i 'm saying ?
are you just repeating what i 'm saying ?
all right , let 's move on .
okay then .

yeah but why didn 't you just say that you didn 't read the book ?
be-because i didn 't want him to think i was stupid i mean , that was really embarrassing what happened to you
phoebe
yeah ?
phoebe you 're note , amazing not only did no one touch my sandwich , but people at work are actually afraid of me . yeah , a guy called me mental mental geller , yeah , i always wanted a cool nickname like that .
yeah , the best you got in high school was wet pants geller .
that was the water fountain okay ? anyway , people are writing reports for me , uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule , i 'm telling you , you get tough with people you can get anything you want . hey tribbiani , give me that coffee now

god , this was really fun i 've been wondering if you were going to ask me out .
so you uh , still wondering ?
no , we just went out .
you 're smart . i like that .

oh , candles what is that ? a blanket ? a video camera ? oh my god
oh no-no-no-no , wait-wait-wait
i can 't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date

what is going on here ?
and with chandler in the next room . what are you , what are you sick ?

i 'm joey . i mean , i 'm disgusting . i make low-budget adult films .

you guys promised you 'd be more careful i mean , come on the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here
we 're so sorry .
yeah .
well , i 'm telling everyone about you that 's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn 't make me look like a pig
no-no , wait there 's got to be a better explanation . you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class .
yeah , i like that . but no-no , how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place ?
ohi don 't know .
well , get ready to come out of the non-gay closet
okay , just wait , please . i promise we 'll come up with something . just give us a little more time .
all right . hey , but it better make me look really , really good . oh , and another thing , the video camera ? nice

umm , ross . may i have a word with you ?
yeah , of course , donald .
we 've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part .
what ?
threatening letters , refusal to meet deadlines , apparently people now call you mental .
yeah .
we want you to speak to a psychiatrist .
oh no , you-you don 't understand . ugh , this is so silly . umm , this is all because of a sandwich .
a sandwich ?
yeah . you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches . her secret is , she puts a , an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle i call it the moist maker . anyway , i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here
oh , you know what ?
what ?
i-i 'm sorry . i , i-i-i believe i ate that .
you ate my sandwich ?
it was a simple mistake . it could happen to anyone .
oh-oh really ? did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker ?
no .
do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it ?
there may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind .
that said it was my sandwich ?
now-now calm down . come look in my office , some of it my still be in the trash .
what ?
well , it was quite large . i-i-i-i-i had to throw most of it away .
you-you-you-you threw my sandwich away

my sandwich ?

my sandwich

hi
hi
so umm , what 's this book about ?
you didn 't read this one either ?
well , i was gonna , but i accidentally read something else .
what ?
vogue hey , so tell me about this jane eyre woman .
no you should 've read it yourself
come on phoebe dont be such a goodie-goodie
fine okay , all right , so jane eyre , first of all , you 'd think she 's a woman , but she 's not . she 's a cyborg .
a cyborg ? isn 't that like a robot ?
yeah , this book was light years ahead of its time .
sorry i 'm late . let 's get started . so , what did everybody think about jane eyre ?
umm , rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights .
well , go ahead rachel .
uh , thank you phoebe . umm , well , what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh , how the book was so ahead of its time .
if you 're talking about feminism , i think you 're right .
yeah , well , feminism yes , but also the robots .

hey .
hey . okay , so umm , since that video camera thing didn 't work out uh , i thought that i would give you just a little preview .
you 're naked in this picture
i know .

ross ?
hey chandler . monica
ross , are you okay ?
i 'm fine i saw a psychiatrist at work today .
why ?
on account of my rage .
which i may say , right now , is out of control .
he gave me a pill for it .
a pill ?
uh-huh . well , when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again , so he offered me a tranquilizer . and i thought was a good idea so , i took it .
wait a minute , they 're making you take time off work ?
and you 're okay with that ?
i don 't know . it 's going to be weird not having a job for a while , but i , i definitely don 't care about my sandwich .

ugh , that was so embarrassing i can 't believe you let me go on and on like that
i 'm sorry . it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop .
that was not funny

because tomorrow he 's redoing yesterday 's pages .
yesterday 's pages did not reflect my best work .
why don 't you cut him a little slack ? okay ? maybe if he relaxes a little bit , he 'll get some work done .
i think he 's been relaxing enough , thanks to you and fireball .
dude , if you think fireball 's relaxing , you 've obviously have never played .
the only reason you 're doing this to joey is because you 're bored . okay , it 's not his fault that you 're unemployed .
i am not unemployed . i 'm on sabbatical
come on look guys , don 't fight .
and the reason i 'm doing this is because i am joey 's friend . and if you were a good friend , you 'd be doing the same thing .
oh , so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk ?
if it does ? then you 're an amazing friend of mine .
hey-hey guys , hey how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball ? huh ? i 'll go unhook the smoke detectors
how about we settle this right now there now , no one 's going to the game . ha-ha-ha

everyday i am gonna do one thing that i haven 't done before . that my friends is my new year 's resolution .
ooh that 's a good one mine is to pilot a commercial jet .
that 's good one too , pheebs . now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who 's resolution is to plummet to their deaths .
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends , especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane .
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us .
in fact , i 'll bet you 50 bucks that you can 't go the whole year without making fun of us . eh , y 'know what , better yet ? a week .
i 'll take that bet my friend . and you know what , paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day and it starts right now
all right , my new year 's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar .
ohh .

well , y 'know those special skills i have listed on my resume ? i would love it would be great if one of those was true .
do you want me to teach you ? i 'm a great teacher .

yeah that 'd be great thanks pheebs
op , look claire forgot her glasses and she 's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend , who , i hear , needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer , if you know what i 'm talking about .
hey rach , maybe your resolution should be to umm , gossip less .
i don 't gossip

well , maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y 'know kinda like a public service , it doesn 't mean i 'm a gossip . i mean , would you call ted kopel a gossip ?
well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs , i would .

okay , so now they know that you know and they don 't know that rachel knows ?
yes , but y 'know what ? it doesn 't matter who knows what . now , enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over
or , we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own .
wh-what do you mean ?
well y 'know every time that they say that like they 're doing laundry we 'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do .
ohhh , i-i would enjoy that

phoebe , it 's me . you can tell me anything .
well actually you 're the one person i can 't tell this too . and the one person i want to the most .
what 's going on ?
i think it 's just y 'know that i haven 't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you 're looking for something and you just dont even see that it 's right there in front of you sipping coffeeoh no , have i said to much ? well it 's just something to think about .

you are so cute how did you get to be so cute ?
well , my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny .
okay , now you 're even cuter
y 'know that is a popular opinion today i must say .
what ?
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house , i think , i think phoebe was hitting on me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm telling you i think phoebe thinks i 'm foxy .
that 's not possible
ow
i 'm sorry it 's just , phoebe just always thought you were , you were charming in a , in a sexless kind of way .
oh , y 'know i-i can 't hear that enough .
i 'm sorry , i think that you just misunderstood her .
no , i didn 't misunderstand , okay ? she was all over me she touched my bicep for crying out loud
this bicep ?
well it 's not flexed right now

hey mon , what are you doing now ? wanna come see a movie with us ?

i mean i-i don 't i think i have enough quarters .
i have quarters
hey
hey ross any word on the apartment yet ?
well , i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he 's already had like a hundred applicants .
oh .
no-no , i got the edge . i know it 's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to
tip the scales in my direction . check it out , you can probably see it from the window .
oh , is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ?
no .
that new mountain bike ?
no .
well what did you send ?
a basket of mini-muffins .
but there 's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets . which one did you send ?
the small one .
what ? you-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment ?
well yeah someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins . it was the best day .
your work makes me sad .
oh man i want that place so much i was so sure that was gonna work there 's twelve bucks i 'll never see again
all right honey , we 'd better go if we wanna catch that movie .
bye
bye
bye chandler i miss you already .
okay , did you see that ? with the inappropriate and the pinching
actually , i did
okay , so now do you believe that she 's attracted to me ?
ohhh , oh my god oh my god she knows about us
are you serious ?
phoebe knows and she 's just trying to freak us out that 's the only explanation for it
okay but what about y 'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsshe knows

joey

yeah ?
phoebe knows about us
well i didn 't tell them
them ? who 's them ?
uhhh , phoebe and joey .
joey
and rachel . i would 've told you but they made me promise not to tell
oh man
i 'm sorry but hey , it 's over now , right ? because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing
unless
no not unless look this must end now
oh man , they think they are so slick messing with us but see they don 't know that we know that they know so
ahh yes , the messers become the messies

noooo .
oh ross , honey you gotta stop torturing yourself
yeah , why don 't you just find another apartment ?
look i 've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one
y 'know what you should do ?
huh ?
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him . yeah like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm , sandwiches . or uh , or my underwear .
i 'm listening .
see ?
that is a great idea and i know ugly naked guy because we 've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge oh , let 's see now he had the trampoline .
he broke that .
well , he had gravity boots .
yeah , he broke those too .
so he likes to break stuff .
okay , i 've got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out . hey , didn 't he used to have a cat ?
i wouldn 't bring that up , it would probably just bum him out .
yeah , poor cat , never saw that big butt coming .
right .

hello oh yeah hey hold on a second she 's right here it 's chandler .
oh ? hello you .
hello phoebe , i 've been thinking about you all day .

nothing
oh , come on you 've been acting strange all day
all right there is something . i kinda had a dream , but i don 't want to talk about it .
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that ? i kinda have a dream i dont want to talk about it .
well , it involved monica .
you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing ? oh , that is so cool i can 't tell you how many times i 've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing . anyway we 're talking about your dream . i love you . your dream ?
don 't worry , there wasn 't any sex in it or anything . i haven 't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish .
what was the dream about ?
well , okay . you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle . y 'know like you guys were doing last night . so , that 's it . i 'm in love with monica and i 'll be moving out .
wait , joey joey that doesnt mean that-that you 're in love with me
it-it doesnt ?
no
no , it can mean anything . like uh , all of the sudden you 're jealous because i 've become the apartment stud .
that kinda sounds like your dream dude .
or , it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y 'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too .
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .
um-hmm .
joey , look , are you attracted to monica ? right here , right now , are you attracted to her ?
not really .
well there you have it
well sure i 'm just wearing sweats but that 's good that you 're not in love with me , because you just want a girlfriend
no , i don 't think it 's just about just getting a girlfriend . y 'know ? i mean , yeah , i can get a girlfriend yeah , we could sit in the chair and do crosswords , but y 'know are we ever going to have y 'know the closeness like-like you guys have ?
well y 'know , monica and i were friends before we started dating . so maybe-maybe that 's it ?
friends first ? that 's interesting .
you become friends after ?
no , never done that either .
hey , umm , do you guys have that tape measure ?
oh yeah , it 's actually in my bedroom .

that 's right .

what 's up joey ?
how you doin ?

excuse me , is this your car ?
yeah .
well i don 't think it 's very nice of you to park here , y 'know you 're blocking the entrance .
don 't worry about it . it 's not a problem .
well , it 's a problem for me , which means it 's a problem for you cause i 'm a cop .
so am i
ohh , no . oh okay , so you 're a cop which means you can park anywhere , cause i know that cause i 'm a cop too . so , all right , keep up the good work . 10-4 .
hey , wait a second so wait , what precinct are you with ?
i-i 'm with the umm , the 57 th .
oh , i know a guy in homicide up there .
i 'm in vice . yeah , in fact i 'm undercover right now . i 'm a whore .
who-who else is in vice up there ?
umm , do you know , umm sipowicz ?
sipowicz ? no , i don 't think so .
yeah , big guy , kinda bald .
no , i don 't know him .
dont try to call him or anything , cause he 's not there , he 's out . his umm , his partner just died .
wow umm , tell sipowicz i 'm real sorry for his loss .
i-i sure will , take care .
hey by the way , i 'm sure sipowicz is gonna be all right . i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good . and where did you find my badge ?
oh .

hey joey , would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch ?
oh , i 'd love too , but i got acting class . but y 'know what ? i guess i can blow that off , for you .

thanks
uh , hey , rach let me ask you something . uh , i was just over there talking to monica and chandler , boy they are really tight .
i know .
yeah that 's not such a bad situation they got going over there . i 'm thinking of getting me one of those .
what 's up joe ?
well , the reason i think monica and chandler are so great
yeah ?
is because they were friends first . y 'know ? so i asked myself , who are my friends ? you and phoebe , and i saw you first . so
what are you saying ?
i 'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .
y 'know honey , umm , as uh , as flattered as i am that uh , you saw me first , uhh , i just , i-i don 't think we should be cranking anything up .
i 'll treat you real nice .
yeah , well , y 'know umm no honey , listen i think it 's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them , but i think the way you do it is y 'know you meet someone , become their friend , build a foundation , then you ask them out on a date .
won 't-won 't that take longer ?
yeah . yeah . oh , but once you find it , ohh it 's so worth the wait .
yeah . i understand . i understand . man , i wish i saw phoebe first

come here to me . no-no , you come here to me .
hey ross i brought reinforcements .
oh great what , you brought joey ?
well , i brought the next best thing .
hey
chandler ? you brought chandler ? the next best thing would be monica
y 'know , i would be offended , but monica is freakishly strong , so
look , i-i drew a sketch about how we 're gonna do it . okay rach , that 's you . that 's the couch .
whoa-oh , what 's-what 's that ?
oh , that 's me .
wow you certainly think a lot of yourself .
no that 's-that 's my arm
oh , i see . i thought you just really , really liked your new couch .
y 'know what ? just-just follow my lead .

okay
okay .
come on , chandler .

all right . okay , here we go

all right , ready ?
yeah .
turn .
okay .
turn turn

okay , i don 't think we can turn anymore
ross , i don 't , i just don 't think it 's going to fit .
oh yeah it will come on , up up-up-up up yes here we go pivot pivot piv-ot piv-et piv-ett piv-et
shut up shut up shut up

okay , i don 't think it 's going to pivot anymore .
you think ?
all right , let 's uh , let 's bring it back down and-and try again .

okay , yeah , i think it 's really stuck now .
i can 't believe that didn 't work
i know , me neither i mean , you had a sketch
oh , y 'know , what did you mean when you said pivot ?

hey
hey how 's it going ? did you make any new friends ?
yeah , yeah , i met this woman .
hey , whoa-whoa what 's she like ?
uhh , well , she 'sreally good in bed .
joey , i thought you were gonna try to be friends first
well look , hey , it 's all your fault
what ? why ?
well because you didn 't give me advice no you gave me a pickup line as soon as i told her i wanted to y 'know , build a foundation and be friends first . i suddenly , through no fault of my own , became irresistible to her and her roommate
what about the closeness ?

monica , you have got to stop this competitive thing okay ? it 's crazy . finally the voice of reason . i mean , just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and i 'm saying no to this , why ? get your coat .

hey

excuse me . you should check this out , tell the other tenants . apparently he 's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl .
who isn 't ?

i don 't , i don 't think we 've meet . i-i 'm ross .
i know . you 're the guy who wouldn 't chip in for the handyman .
nevermind
no , i-i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted . i mean you had just moved in .
i had just moved in . thank you listen umm
jen .

hey joey isn 't that the girl that waved at you the other day ?
i don 't know . but i can see through your sheet . yeah , yeah , that 's her . but y 'know what ? doesn 't matter , i 'm never gonna get to meet her anyway .
why ?
because it 's impossible to find her apartment she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe , or something .
what are you talking about ? she obviously lives on the second floor , seventh apartment from the left
no . no . no . she lives on the third floor , eighth apartment from the left .
no , those first two windows , that 's the lobby . and y 'know the other one over there , that 's the stairway . you 've been counting wrong .
i did not know that thank you monica . i can 't believe i almost lost another girl because of counting .

so uhh , you ready ?
sure , i 'll just get my coat . could you get that ?
sure . joey
dahhhhh no noooo

ah , first , i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .
that 's quite all right , but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped .
okay . umm , well , first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh , for yelling at you .
fair enough .
now you 're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah , who did , who did not umm , yell at you and storm out , and i think that 's a big mistake and here 's why . i made a huge fool of myself and i came back , that shows courage .
zelner .
zelner right i knew that i really , really want this job and i think , i think i would be really good at it .
y 'know what ? i may regret this but uh , i 'm going to give you a shot .
oh you are ?
um-hmm .
really ? oh thank you oh oh , would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?
yes
okay , well then how about a handshake ? oh god i 'm sorry oh god , i 'm sorry i did not mean to touch thati mean you there . there . uhh , okay , so thank-thank you , i 'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh , thank you sohey i 'll see you

you tired chandler ?
you better believe he 's tired , after the day we had if you know what i mean . you know what i mean ?

phoebe , you have a , a twig in your hair .
ohh , umm , we kinda took a little detour on the way over here .
yeah , we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around , so
you didn 't
we did we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code
the park huh ? a public place .
uh-huh .
i hear ya . excuse me for just a second

hi chandler .
monica this is the men 's room isn 't it ?
yes it is . you see i 've always found the men 's bathroom very sexual . haven 't you ?
no . and if i did , i don 't think we 'd be going out . monica , this is getting ridiculous
come on , we can 't let them win
ugh , we have already proved that we are hot okay ? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing ?
because phoebe and gary are in that-can 't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase
so ?
i feel really sad that we 're notreally there anymore .
oh wow is that what this all have been about ?
wasn 't it a lot more exciting when we were y 'know all over each other all the time ?
yeah that was great . that was really great but to tell you the truth , i 'm more excited about where we are right now .
really ?
yeah i 've never been in a relationship that 's lasted this long before . y 'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time , i think that 's pretty incredible . and the fact that this is happening all with you , yeah i think that 's pretty exciting .
that is so sweet . i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm , i feel the same way .
yeah ?
yeah .
y 'know what i just realized ? you just freaked out about our relationship .
did not .
yes you did admit it you freaked out
okay , i freaked out a little .
little ? you freaked out big time okay ? and i fixed it we have switched places i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy , irrational screw up and now we 're back .

ugh
y 'know what , this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she 's trying to play on him .

yeah well unless we tell him .
well , if you 're gonna be totally rational about this , i can 't argue with you all right ? fine , if you wanna tell him , tell him . i just don 't want to be a part of it .

hey ross it 's you i just want you to remember this feeling . you are lucky to be alive so live everyday to the fullest . love yourself , okay ? okay . oh , and also get stamps . bye

my god , joey
it was a car backfire
yeah , but-but he didn 't know that
yeah , i didn 't know that .
and it could 've just as easily have been a bullet .
hey joe , you ever think about joining the force ? we could use a guy like you .
who jumps at loud noises
wow i could 've died tonight .
yeah if the car that backfired had run over you y 'know what , i think i 'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .
i do have a newfound respect for life .
oh my god
so you wanna get some dinner ?
yeah sure yep oh , y 'know what ? if i heard a shot right now , i 'd throw my body on you .
oh yeah ? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood .
okay
all right .
bye
bye

cut it out ross i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day

dude how come you took off ?
oh , i just went for a walk , around the living room . whatever
is something wrong ?
no . no i 'm just tired . y 'know , from-from the walk .
okay .
you dove in front of ross ross
that 's what this is about oh my god , you hate ross
i do not hate ross
of course you do i saved him you 're mad at me it all adds up you want ross out of the picture .
what picture ?
i don 't know , but i don 't like what i 'm hearing
look i 'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire , but y 'know , it could 've been a bullet and you y 'know , you didn 't try to save me
ohh , you 're upset because you think i chose ross over you no iknewyou could take care of yourself . y 'know , i mean ross , he need help . he 's not street like us
when it comes down to it , you would risk your life for ross before you would for me . that 's the bottom line .
well , no , not exactly all right , look , i , i wasn 't trying to save ross . okay ? my sandwich was next to ross . all right ? i was , i was trying to save my sandwich .
from a bullet
i know it doesn 't make much sense
much sense ?
look chandler , it was instinct okay ? i just went for it
so you risked your life , for a sandwich
i know it sounds crazy , but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world
so you didn 't uh , choose ross before me .
no i would never do that you-you 're like my brother
really ?
yeah in fact , to prove how much you mean to me , here .
thanks .
no , eh , oh-oi , easy , it 's not a hot dog

how good is that ?
oh-oi-ho , yeah
see ?
hm-hmm .
oh-whoa-hey , dude , what are you doing ?
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .
yeah . with a bite gee-e-e-eez

hey hi
rach , what uh , what are you doing here ?
hey y 'know what ? you are in our apartment all the time okay ? this is , this is just a drop in the bucket mister
y 'know , it-it doesn 't matter . the important thing is that you 're here . you 're my friend , and you 're here . oh
okay , just a little scared . what 's going on ross ?
the most amazing thing happened tonight . i thought my number was up . i had an actual near death experience
what ? what ? what happened ?
okay , okay , we were on the ride along with gary , right ?
yeah
and somebody took a shot at me
really ?
no , a car backfired , but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me . and rach , ii survived and i was filled with this-this great respect for life . y 'know ? i-i want to experience every moment . i want to seize every opportunity . i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now .
because a car backfired ?
okay , why are you here ?
well , i-i-i don 't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um , emily called you today .
you talked to her ?
no , she left a message . but it-it kinda got erased . there 's just something wrong with your machine .
well , okay , what-what did she say ?
well , uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh , she wants you to call her .
wow
now , that-that was a good thing that i told you , right ?
huh ? yeah yes , of course
okay . thank you thank you becausei 'm sorry , all right . because y 'know what ? she didn 't want menot important . the point is , i was right . your decision . okay ? i was right . your decision .
right . i guess , i guess i should call emily .
okay , no , that 's not the right decision . that 's not , that 's not right , no ross-ross , come on i mean , that woman made you miserable okay , ross , do you really want to get back into that ?
okay , look , yesterday i would 've even considered calling her back , but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience . i mean , that-that has got to mean something
ugh , ross that was not a near death experience that was barely an experience
you weren 't there okay , maybe this is something that i-i 'm supposed to seize y 'know ?
okay , y 'know what ? maybe , this is not about seizing stuff . maybe this is about escaping stuff .
huh .
i mean , look-look today you escaped death , y 'know ? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?
that does make sense . because i do wanna seize some opportunity , but i-i really don 't wanna see or talk to her .
well , there you go
yeah . maybe today is just , close call day .
close call day .

ohh , honey no problem . okay .

no .
hey umm , was-was monica here ?
yeah .
yeah , i want my money back .
yeah , uh you-you probably need that for stamps , right ?

hey pheebs , has gary ever been shot at for real ?
yes . once . yeah , a little . he kinda did it to himself . it 's not really a good story .
i wonder how i would react under fire , y 'know ? and not backfire but-but heavy fire , like i was in a war or something .
man , i would be great in a war i mean , i really , i think i would make a fantastic military leader . i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?
i know where joey would be . he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .
yes , if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .
yeah , hero sandwiches .
well you all know that i 'm a pacifist so i 'm not interested in war in any way . but y 'know what ? when the revolution comes , i will have to destroy you all . not you joey .

would you like some more coffee , baby-doll ?
i 'm fine , thanks .
yeah , see , i can 't pull of baby-doll can i ?
no . i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident . i 'm gonna get some tea .
okay .

hiya doin pumpkin ?
nope .

so it looks like it 's going really well for you two , huh ?
i know , really well . in fact , i 'm gonna ask phoebe to move in with me .
oh my god
what do you , what do you think ?
i think that is so great when are you gonna ask her ?
tonight , but don 't say anything . okay ?
i swear , i promise . i promise . oh my god , i 'm so excited and i just can 't hide it i 'm about to lose control and i think i like it sorry , just couldn 't resist it . all right , listen let me tell you , do not get her flowers . okay
i 'll see you after work sweetie .
okay . bye

so , what movie should we see ?
gary 's gonna ask you to move in with him
what ? really ?
he just told me at the counter . he made me promise not to tell , but i couldn 't hold it in any longer
i can 't believe this
right , because it 's fast . because , it 's so fast . it 's fast
relax it 's phoebe not you
oh good for you pheebs , way to go
no , but it is fast . isn 't it ?
ohhhh
no , i like him a lot but i don 't think i 'm ready for this
so , what are you gonna do ?
i don 't know . i 'll just handle iti 'll ask you to talk to him
me ? why me ?
because you are so afraid of commitment you talk to him , make him scared like you make him aman
i 'll try , but i 'm not sure what good it would do , y 'know ? because i 'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be .
that is so sweet
still terrified , i 'll take care of it . no problem .

hey ross , is uh , is staten island really an island ?
uh-huh , that 's why they call it staten island .
ohhh . i thought it was like long island .
also an island .

hey , what time is it ?
2 17 .
wow you realize that we 've been throwing this ball , without dropping it , for like an hour ?
are you serious ?
yeah . i realized it about a half-hour ago but i didn 't want to say anything cause i didn 't want to jinx it .
wow we are pretty good at this hey we totally forgot about lunch
oh , i-i , i think that 's the first time i ever missed a meal yeah , my pants are a little loose
hey , you guys
hey
is monica here ?
no .
all right listen umm , i just bought something i 'm not sure she 's gonna like it , and it 's gonna seem a little crazy , but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl .
you bought shawn cassidy
noo i wish okay , you ready ?
yeah
okay check it out

what-what is it ?
what the hell is that ?
it 's a , it 's a cat
that , is not a cat i have to agree with joey on this one .
yes it is
why is it inside out ?
excuse me but this is a purebred , show-quality sphinx cat
how much did you pay for that ?
well , it was a little extravagant , but i a pretty good deal .
yeah ? how much ?
a thousand bucks .
on a cat ? ?
it 's not a cat
all right listen ball boys my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing i mean it was so cute , it would sit in my lap and purr all day long , and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
free cats do that too , y 'know . which reminds me , if i might get a little political here , support your local animal shelter . pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from , you get a much better deal from the shelter , plus they probably won 't die on you in
it 's not a cat
ugh look you guys , i 'm really excited about this okay ? i don 't care what you think i 'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson . well , what am i gonna call her ? fluffy ?

hey , you wanna get something to eat or uh , do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ? huh ?
uhh , the ball thing .
yeah ?
hey ross , wouldn 't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it ?
uhh , yeah it would let 's do it
okay

uh-oh .
what ?
i have to pee . and rachel 's in the bathroom

man , i didn 't think we were gonna make it
i know don 't switch hands , okay ?

hey ladies what are you in here for ?
hey chandler , what are you doing here ?
gary , i 'm here to report a crime .
yeah ?
it is a crime that you and i don 't spend more time together .
what 's up ?
well , i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe , we should have a talk . man to uh , me .
sure . okay .
uh , are you crazy ? are you insane ? if you live with phoebe , you two are gonna be y 'know , live-living together
yeah , i-i considered that . i just know it would make me happy .
you mean scared .
no , i mean happy .
scared ? happy ?
chandler , what-what are you doing ?
i am trying to open your eyes , my man don 't you see , if you lived with phoebe she 's always gonna be there . you 're gonna get home , she 's there . you go to bed , she 's there . you wake up and oh yes , she 's there
i know i can 't wait
were you 're parents happy , or something ?
listen chandler , the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love . i justi wanna be around her as much as i can .
wow , y 'know when you say it , it doesn 't sound so scary .
so you know what i 'm talking about , right ?
yeah , i think i do y 'know what ? you move in with her you move in with her right now maybe i should in with monica
no , it 's too soon for you guys .
yeah , you 're right about that .

now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws how did it get there ?
y 'know , sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up . but it won 't work . i 'll always have the last laugh < manical laugh.wav > okay , so maybe i 'm a little deluded , it 's probably just my spellchecker . but , i must
maybe this should be more of a quiet game .
oh , all right geez , i can 't have any fun
hey guys
hi
joey , i left my watch on the counter last night . it was right here , where is it ?
i don 't know .
all right , come on , i 'm-i 'm late for work
how do you know ? you don 't have a watch .
guys , could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it
oh , i don 't know . yeah , can 't do it .

what ?
monica , whatever you do , do not drop that ball
yeah , we haven 't dropped it in
2 hours , 27 minutes .

doesn 't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat .
what ? you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300
well , i was gonna let you play with it .

hi

yes i did , and i think you should do it .

yeah okay .
you look very pretty today .
thanks okay .
here 's the thing .
yeah ?
y 'know i really want to move this relationship forward .
uh-hmm .
because if you 're not moving forward , y 'know you 're just moving backwards .
no that 's not true . if you 're not moving forward , you 're just staying still . and staying still is good . watch this .
phoebe ?
yeah ?
i want you to move in with me .
that is so sweet . but don 't you think it 's a little too soon ? i mean there 's so much we don 't know about each other .
oh . oh-oh-okay , i get it .
i justi don 't want us to jump into something we 're not ready for .
uh-huh .
i really don 't want to mess up what we have . i 'm justi 'm worried it 's gonna be a big mistake .

baking it didn 't help , huh ?
so , why don 't you just take it back to where you got it ?
i tried they won 't take her back .
maybe that 's because she 's a minion of the anti-christ .
rach , why won 't they take it back ?
well , they said would but they would only give me store credit . i mean , what am i going to do , get a thousand regular cats ?
look , if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it .

oh .

nice job joe youre quite the craftsmen .

hey
hey check it out this is unbelievable joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes

dude what are yoyou trying to kill me ?
pheebs , i wanna ask you something .
uh-huh , what ?
well since im movin out and-and youre so beautiful
oh
how about i move in with you ?
well , that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?
whos denise ?
my roommate .
you have a roommate ?
yes , denise . denise
hey , what is with the secrecy phoebe ? huh ? and what about this denise , is she cute ?
pheebs , i dont understand . how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say . i talk about her all the time denise
hey rach , listen i was thinkin uh , im gonna have an extra room over at my place
oh , thats true .
yeah , why dont you move in with me ? itll be great we could stay up late , watch movies , and you know about naked thursdays right ?
yeah , yeah i think im gonna find my own place .
hey-hey i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man

hey .
hey
so , what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?
oh , that . umm , she took it really well .
you didnt tell her did you ?
no .
of course not , because youre in love with her .
i am not in love with her . she was very upset about having to move out so i eh , didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset . i-i just comforted her , as a friend .
what do you mean , comforted her ?
its nothing , i just gave her a hug .
ah-ha a classic sign of love , the hug
its also a sign of friendship .
yeah , not in your case lovey loverson .
it was a hug
okay , just tell me this , did you or did you not smell her hair ?
s-s-smell her hair ? what if i did ?
ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head thats why , thats why women are shorter . so that men will fall in love when they hug them oh come on ross , youre a scientist .
i was hugging her as a friend . its not my fault her-her hair got in my face , shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty . what ? oh , that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts
okay , whatever you say . but just be careful , all right ? rachels not in the same place you are .
if the place you are referring too is being in love , then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place
okay , i didnt understand that , but yknow , maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love

hey dude , some guy just called for you .
who was it ?
i dont know how about , thanks for taking the message . jeez
okay listen , yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty , you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?
sure
okay , i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room , right ? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here okay , whatever , i really havent
well , i like that idea . obviously i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room , yknow ? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like space invaders and asteroids for $ 200 , the real ones the big-big ones
no .
okay so you mean no as in , gee chandler , what an interesting idea . lets discuss it before we reject it completely .
oh , im sorry . of course i mean that . interesting idea , umm , talk about it , but no .
so , thats it ?
i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room . the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .
which is why asteroids is perfect its the oldest game
what do you have against the beautiful guest room ?
i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room , especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away
are you mocking me ?
no , im not mocking you , or you beautiful guest room .

hey , whats up ?
nothing , monica and i had a stupid fight .
but youre still moving in together , right ? because my ad came out today .
wanted . female roommate , non-smoker , non-ugly . nice
yeah ? i just figured yknow , after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate , yknow ? someone i can learn from , someone-someone whos different than me . and whats more different than me a guy whos not 19 than say a girl who is 19 ? enh ? not

pheebs , i have to ask you
shhhhhh im swamped right now .
youre just staring into space .
umm , im trying to move that pencil .
this one ?
it worked
pheebs , this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak . i mean , look at this wanted . female roommate , non-smoker , non-ugly . its just , there is nothing the citys full
wait , no , look at this two bedroom , two bath , must be non-smoker , satan worshipers okay oh , yeah , but its on the ground floor .
hey
hey .
rach , uh , you still looking for a place ?
yeah why ?
okay , theres this guy , warren , from the museum and hes going on a dig for like two years and hes got this great place he needs to sublet . so uh , you interested ?

hero , i uh , i dont knowwell , all right .
oh , i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has
oh please youre gonna say things now , arent ya ?
no . no , i wont . but i should tell you this , this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise . she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her , but he really did , and it just blew up and thats how she ended up

hi .
hi .
hi , listen , im sorry about before . i dont need to have a game room . i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls , and now i can emnow , i have you . not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property
stop it chandler . im sorry too .
really ?
yeah oh yes
ohh .
listen , we dont have to make that a guest room , we can think of something to do with the room together .
thats a great idea we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .
totally

we dont have to come up with this now .
oh good .
hey , yknow what ? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room ?
changes ?
yeah , i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .
youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here ?
is that a problem ?
well , its a set and they should probably stay together .
oh , thats cool . then ill just bring them both over .
see now-now youre taking them away from their home .
okay , i get it . so , i get nothing nothing here is mine everything here is yours ill get up in the morning put on your clothes , and head off to work
yeah-yeah , yknow what ? yeah , thats it-thats it , everything will be mine nothing will be yours thats-thats what i said oh come on , chandler im talking about the barca lounger it just , it doesnt match where is it gonna go ?
in the game room
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly
all right thats fine thats fine i wont bring over the chairs i wont bring anything over i wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandmas place

everything on your application looks really goodohh just one last question umm , are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?
oh dont worry , im not really a party girl .
whoa now look , dont be just blurtin stuff out . i want you to really think about your answers . okay ?
you can call off the roommate search hi ill be living here .
oh dont listen to him , hes just some guy who really wants the apartment , but i dont think hes gonna get it .
why did you take the shower curtain down ?
that thing was a hazard im very safety conscious .

hey
hey oh listen , i was just clearing some space for your stuff .
oh thanks , but listen , i was just at monicas and she and chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in .
what do you mean , theyre not moving in ? they-theyre still moving in right ?
no-no , they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .
what ? over a stupid room
yeah , i feel kinda bad for them , but im also really psyched cause i dont have to move in here
oh no , yeah no , that parts great

whats all this about you guys fighting ? is this really over a room ? i mean , that is so silly
ross , we can handle this .
well , apparently not , and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly . i mean , enough of the silliness
well , why dont you tell her to stop being silly
okay-okay two very good points , look ive known you both a long time , and ive never seen either of you one millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together . do you really want to throw that all away over a room ? that is so silly . now wh-what is more important , love or
well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
love is the best medicine .
thats laughter .
why do you do it ?
i dont know .
okay all right now , chandler you-you wanna live with monica , right ?
yeah , i do .
and mon , you wanna live with chandler , dont ya ?
yes .
good a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york

so i understand youre looking for a place .
no-no , im staying put .
oh , i was going to offer you my apartment .
why , where are you going ?
i dont know .
hey rach
hi
youre never gonna believe it uh , monica and chandler are moving in again . thats great news righti mean for them . right ?
oh wow .
yeah but , on the bright side , we get to be roommates again .
yeah . yknow umm , uh , umm , about that , umm , ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything , but dont you think its gonna be weird ?
wh-why ? why-why-why would it , why would it be weird ?
well , because of us because of our history .
no
no ?
no no it would be weird if we were still in that place , i mean are you still in that place ?
no not at all
good me neither so its not a problem . were just two friends who happen to be roommates .
okay , but ross , eventually you and i are gonna be dating .
really ? we are ?
yeah im gonna have a boyfriend , youre gonna have a girlfriend
ohh that would be great .
but yknow what , if you think its gonna be okay well just work out a system . yknow , itll be like college , ill hang a hanger on the door and put a sign , come back later , im gettin lucky .
yeah , i didnt think of that .

so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ? i mean its a really big step and-and whats the rush ?

thats very funny
hes being silly , because he knows that we enjoy the silliness
no , i-i-im serious , okay ? i mean , think about it . you move in , you start fighting over stupid game rooms , next thing yknow you break up
ross , you were right before , it was just a stupid fight about a room .
okay , there are no stupid fights this isnt about the room , this is about what the roomrepresents and unfortunately , this room could destroy you
yeah , i 'm not so worried .
yeah , no , me neither .
fine its your life i just dont want to see you guys break up which you will do if you move in together , but thats what you want , theres nothing i can do . dont do it
you still want to move in together right ?
of course
ross didnt scare you ?
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .
come here , i want to show you something
okay

oh my god someones killed square man
this is where i thought the barca lounger could go you see you could see the tv and its still walking distance to the kitchen .

maybe you could be my roommate
well theres an idea
yeah

december 26 th , huh maybe shes santa clause .

oh look who it is , my husband . the apple of my eye .
okay , i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2 00 and i picked up all the forms . ill take care of everything .

okay rach , but
op youre peeping

ross yknow what , i just gotwhy ? why did you do this ?
look i told you
i dont wanna hear three failed marriages
look , if youd had two failed marriages , youd understand
well , yknow what ? thanks to you im half way there ugh oh i am so mad ross , i dont think i have ever been this angry
what about the time i said we were on a break ?
ugh

pheebs , hows it going ?
im doing okay . i think its going well . do you think theyre having fun ? am i talking to fast ?
nope , sound like me . pheebs , its going great . look at chandler with little baby girl chandler .
little baby girl chandler , where i have heard that before ? oh right , coach ruben . do you know what pheebs ? when youre done over there , we kinda have a situation over here too .
na-uh , no , we are all responsible for our own babies .
see thats where i think that youre wrong . weve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense .
what do you mean ?
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone . phoebe , you can be in charge of wiping . and yknow mon , you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
that sounds really great , but maybe you should be in charge of wiping .
okay , im a rookie . i should not be in the end zone .

this is so great this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .
yeah ? well this is not what i ordered .
hey guys
hey
hey
hey babies oh , im having the best morning . that uh , that porsche ive got the keys too , still there
shocking since you still have the keys .
you should see the treatment i get when im with that car people are friendly they-they wanna talk , and not just about the car one guy gave me advice about my equity investments .
what equity investments ?
the ones that got me the porsche will you keep up but i figured , if-if people keep seeing me just standing there , theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it . so i figured ill wash it . right ? monica , you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?
oh yeah , i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound .
you dont even have a car
i know . but umm , one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building , so i washed it .
and ?
and six others .
there you are .

yeah , she tops out at 130 .
guy 2 wow
and thats just in the city . i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate .
guy 2 really you got a place upstate ?
sure
guy 2 well , ill see you later .
okay , take it easy .
hey thats my car .
really ? oh uh , oh just give me five more minutes with it .
what-what are you doing ?
oh i-i uh , found the keys and now im just polishing her up .
but its my car
yeah , but its my wax .
listen , i-i-i dont come to this city much so i dont know if youre crazy or this is some kind of street theater , but could i have my keys .
sure . here . ill uh , save your parking spot .
im not coming back .
why not ?
i live upstate .
yeah , so did i.

i dont know why i was so nervous about this . and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining . this is so easy .
yeah , two hours , a lifetime thats the same .
check it out check it out when the babies wake up , they can meet krog
chandler , what are you doing ? that thing can put someones eye out
he can do more than that he can destroy the universe
no chandler , they can swallow one of those little parts and also , look at his smooth area , thats just gonna mess them up .
theyre not gonna swallow anything , you guys are being way over protective . when i was a kid , my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
what ?
glass , sand , whatever .
oh , look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .
oh its so cute . i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .
oh , i can still do that .
how are you still single ?
all right . i thought about it and maybe youre right . maybe krog is not a safe toy .
good . what made you change your mind ?
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .
how did that happen ?
well , i was trying to prove that i was right . yknow ? and it turns out i was wrong . and now its lodged in my throat .
damnit yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and , and no one was watching chandler

okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?
yes your honor , and here are , are forms , all filled out .
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable .
fine , im mentally unstable .
and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user .
what ?
uh yes , heroin and crack .
crack isnt even an intravenous drug
well , you would know .
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?
oh , come on
ross , please , i found the magazines
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage . well , that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .
okay , im sorry , this is insane i-i-im not addicted to heroin , im not gay , and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything look , ill consummate this marriage right here , right now
that wont be necessary .
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
ugh
now if you were two involved in a serious relationship , that really creates a problem .
ross your honor , rest assured relationship ended like two years ago and could you strike consummated like bunnies from the record ?
is there , anything in this record that is actually true ?
well , yes , we got married in vegas and uh , and the names i think .
well , based on what i heard , you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment . if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .
thats great are you happy now ? look what you did with your funny , funny form
what ? me ? what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense
and what what are you typing that for ? did you hear what she said ? we dont get the annulment . dont type that what ? stop typing hey stop typing stop typing stop typing
okay , do you see , do you see what youre keeping me married too ?
you need to get out of my chambers .
all right look lady here is the deal , i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one
yeah
would you like to spend the night in jail ?
and thank you for your time .

so the porsche guy took his car back .
but you found the keys to his clothes ?
no . no , i just uh , i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .
and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes ?
of course only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car right ?
that is true .
yeah , but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .
oh , ive been there . yeah , i am gonna go drive my porsche .
joey , you know you dont actually have one .
come on what are you doing ? im in character would you talk to her
ahh , i think it just moved . its really poking me .
all right , thats it , were going to the emergency room .
what ? no , you cant , you cant leave me here with them were baby-sitting
the babies are asleep , im sure youll be okay on your own for a while
but you-you cant leave me with them we-were a team were playing a zone theyre gonna triple team me
hes got something plastic lodged in his throat , weve got to go to the hospital .
but no , because a doctor wont be able to help him , its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years .
i think thats gum .
im pretty sure its gun .
okay , listen this really hurts . lets go .
a real man wouldnt just run to the hospital no what would , what would krog do ?

why isnt that valet back with my porsche ?
maybe because youve got the keys ?
porsche .

this is totally your fault
my fault ? you threatened the judge
well , you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing
hi how are the gellers ?
dont call us that
the judge wouldnt let us get an annulment now we gotta get a divorce did a porsch throw up on you ?
hey its porsche

me taking care of you is no problem , huh ? you guys feel safe . right ? okay , im gonna take that spit bubble as , yeah , i do okay , after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie , ill set you up with a clean one . okay , im sorry . i didnt

hey
how do you feel ?
well , lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .
okay , so i totally took care of the babies all by myself i fed em , bathed em , and put em to bed .
and protected them from a tornado ?

oh my god .
i know , the babies are asleep .
phoebe , what , what happened here ?
i did it i took care of the babies all by myself
but my apartment
was the setting of phoebes triumph .
but the mess
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .
youre right , youre right i shouldnt freak out . cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies when will that be ?
phoebe , would you take a look at this mess

oh honey thank god youre home , i was getting worried .
i picked up the divorce papers . uh , ive already signed everything and i put little xs where you need to sign .
oh , little xs great that makes up for everything
yknow , i-iyouve done a lot of stupid stuff too okay ?
oh , name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one
okay , how about you flew to london to stop my wedding ah , how about you told me you loved me after i was already married
hey wait a minute that was different i did those things because i was in love with you
yeah right

youre right . thats very different . so lets , lets just sign the papers . all right ? what ?
nothing .
okay , can we just sign please ?
uh-hmm .
congratulations .
okay ross , werewait a minute . umm , i uh , i kinda have a little confession .
what ?
well , yknow this whole marriage thing , kinda my idea .
excuse me ?
well , remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?
yeah ?
and uh , yeah , i didnt really , i didnt want to say anything , but it kinda it just , it kinda kept coming back to me , and umm , remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes . and uh , and i
so then if-ifi mean if you think about it , this is all your fault .
yeah , dont push it though .
ive got to say i know i divorce a lot of women , never thought i would be divorcing you .
i know . i always thought if you and i got married , it would be the one that stuck . and it wouldnt be a secret , and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .
did i , did i even treat ?
no , it was on the house , it was , it was a newlywed special .
that may be the most depressing thing ive heard in my life . i should probably get these to my lawyers office .
hey , thanks ross , for taking care of all of this .
eh , no problem .

im gonna need a copy of those .
totally .

hey hey be careful around my porsche
hi joey .

oh come on , come on , it can 't be that bad .
it 's worse . the only thing that 's getting me through is knowing that i 'm gonna be seeing you soon . i think i may even try to get out of here early .
no no-no-no-no-no-no . it sounds like they really need you down there .
well , are you just hanging out with ross ?
it 's , all good okay bye-bye mon she 's-she 's gonna kill me .
yeah , the phone was facing the other way . and that goes back up there .

we should start with the big stuff . yknow ? that 'll be the easiest . uh , let 's start with the couch . i got it .
yeah that-that , doesn 't look right .
what are you talking about ? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet . and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the ok , ok , here 's what we do , we just uh , move the couch closer to the coffee table .
whoa , whoa , but then the back of the couch won 't line up with he back of the carpet .
ok well here , we 'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch .
whoa , whoa , whoa , but then the coffee table won 't be centered in the seating area .
yes , but the coffee table doesn 't match the blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd btyds rooosss
look , what am i gonna do ? i 'm not flirting but still , i 'm drawing her to me like like a moth to a flame what the hell 's going on over here ? ? ? monica 's gonna kill you look i need your help , i have to do something to-to repel this woman wait
hey , i 've been married 3 times

no-no-no i 've seen it happen , you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it . what 's your secret ?
look , we do not repel women ok ? that is completely untrue .
oh no , yes we do my man . remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine ?
yeah , well what about you ? you weren 't you know , so hot in college either . after everything he said , he 'd go ba dum bum chessh
yeah , monica doesn 't like that either , maybe i should stop doing that .
oh y 'know what , girls don 't like it when i start talking about science .
that 's not specific to girls .
this is great , this is great , what else , what else ?
uh , they don 't like it when you correct their grammar .
and they don 't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .
they don 't like it when you keep asking them if they like you .
man , i 'm so lucky i have monica .
i 'm never gonna find love again .

hey phoebe , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure
okay , um , i all right phoebe look , i just wanted to say that i 'm sorry . ok ? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you .
so , what should you have done ?
well , i-i should 've told you the truth .
uh-huh , which is ?
well , y 'know , the reason i didn 't wanna go running with you is because um , well y 'know the way that you run is a little
so ?
well , it 's embarrassing . people were looking at us like we were crazy .
why do you care ?
because they 're people .
but people that you don 't know and will never see again .
yes , but still . they 're peoplewith eyes .
well , i didn 't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no , okay . no , no , i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you . yeah , okay . you 're uptight .
i-i am not uptighthey-hey-hey-oh-oh listen , i am not uptight , man .
that 's okay rachel . i 'm not judging you that 's just who you are . me . i 'm more free y 'know ? i run like i did when i was a kid , cause that 's the only way it 's fun . y 'know , i mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought

okay , is this lamp in the same place ?
who cares ? i repel women .

no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no you can 't come in here r-r-r-r-ross is naked .
what ?
what ?
i couldn 't say that i was naked because she 's allowed too see me naked .
why does anyone have to be naked ?
why is ross naked ?
i-i had to show chandler something ?
naked ?
yeah-yeah i uh , i have a uh , a guy problem .
is it the same thing that chandler had ?
look , uh , just come later , we 'll get everything squared away and you can come back later .
okay , listen , there 's still some of chandler 's medicine under the sink in the bathroom . bye
bye thank god
dude , what 'd you have ?
look , we have no time okay ? we must focus . we gotta get everything back into its original place .
the photo album there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album . we just go through it and match everything to the pictures .
that 's perfect that 's brilliant
so really , what 'd ya have ?

hey joey , i got some beer for you .
uh , don 't you mean for whom ?
sure , listen i was gonna order some pizza , you wanna share one ?
pizza , heh , its not like i never had that before ba dum bum cheshhh .
is there something wrong ?
all right , all right , let 's just get this out in the open okay ? you 're hot . i 'm lovable . clearly there 's a vibe going on between us . but , we 're roommates and it 's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road .
joey
no , no , no , i 'm telling ya . imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay ? so the question is , what do we do ?
well , i don 't think there is anything to do . i mean i think you 're really sweet , but i 'm just not interested in you like that .
oh
no i mean you 're a really nice guy and i 'm happy to be your roommate and your friend , i 'm just y 'know , i just don 't feel that way about you .
oh i see what happened . it 's because i was trying to repel you . right ? believe me , you 'd feel a lot different if i turned it on .
i don 't think so .
oh , i do . how you doin ?
i 'm ok
what ? ?
what ?
oh dear god

hey
hey
oh honey , i 'm so sorry , you were right , this feels great
see ? and you don 't care if people are staring , it 's just for a second cause then you 're gone
gone i mean its amazing pheebs . i feel so free and so graceful . hey look out for the horse sorry

is it okay for me to come in now ?
uh-huh
why is everything different ?
bye
no , i don 't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it .
well , the end table is wrong , the couch looks bizarre and don 't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets .
okay look , don 't don 't be mad okay ? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you , so , i-i-i cleaned the apartment . so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it , where it went back and i 'm sorry , i 'm very sorry , i
it 's okay . chandler , are you afraid of me or something ?
do you want me to be afraid of you ?
of course not . i mean gosh , chandler what you did , it 's , it 's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it . i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place , but i 'd never expect you to worry about that .
really ?
of course
oh well you 're the best . you come here to me .
all right , hold on okay ? first thing 's first . okay , now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked ?

so it said that by the year 2030 , there 'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain . so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer
and live forever as a machine

you know what ? this has been kind of a girlie day . youre right , im sorry .
nah , nah , its okay . i feel like i need to be in guy place . you know , do kind of like a man thing .

you didnt cancel the fabric order from taiwan ?
okay , two things didnt happen . remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room ? well , it turns out thats not true .
thats not true ?
no .
oh thats interesting ? because i checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you , rachel .
oh no , no , no . oh god , you think i made out with him .
listen to me . if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job . you are sadly mistaken .
i-i dont want your job . i-i dont . ohh this is such a mistake . i did not make out with him . nobody made out with him . i did not use my keycard yesterday . i dont even know how to use my keycard .
hi ralph .
hi kim .
yeah , nothing happen . you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife .

and after that , what could i do except become a chef .
mmm-hmm .
and someday soon , i hope to open my own restaurant .
mmm .
you know , youre a really great listener . most guys i go out with , they just talk and talk .
mm-hmm .
after a while its like , shut your mouth , you know ?
hmm-hmm .
ive probably been talking too much . why dont we talk about you a little bit ?
mmm-unmm .
come on . i want to know .

so whats really neat . if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan , your arrangement will look fresh much longer .
oh my god , joey , that is such a great tip .
monica , could you excuse us for a second ? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .
okay . oh but joey , come over later because im going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter .

now , she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job .
but why didnt you just tell her the truth .

well , hey , what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ? you know . what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man ? huh , did she ever think of that ?
you were with kenny today , werent you ?
just for a second .
ohh , phoebe , what am i going to do ?
well , the only thing you can do . sleep with ralph lauren .

well , if thats what you want . ill just put it all in my room .
greatgreatand thanks for being so understanding . i mean , i didnt want to make a big deal out of this , you know . you could , uh , put the picture of the famous baby in my room . i mean , if you want to .
okay .
and , uhh , maybe the watering can there .
sure .
and a couple of these little tiny boxes .
joey ? do you want me to put it all in your room ?
okay .

okay , great bye . so guess who  s coming to thanksgiving dinner ?
sydney portier ? hehheh .

i miss rachel . no , my parents .
oh that  s great , they haven  t seen the place since i moved in

yeah , and y  know , if you could not mention to them that we live together , that would be great , i was thinking we would eat around four .

why can  t i tell them that we live together ?
because they don  t know we  re dating . do you think we should eat in the kitchen ?
why haven  t you told them ?
um , well , i was going to , i-i-i really was . but um , then somewhere , just out of nowhere , i didn  t .
why haven  t you told them ? wouldn  t they be happy ?
so dinner in the kitchen around four i  ll see you then .
why wouldn  t they be happy ?
well , um , because mainly , um , they don  t like you . i  m sorry .
what ? what ? why ?
maybe because you used to be aloof , or that you  re really sarcastic , or that , y  know , you joke around all the time . or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .
is this why they don  t like me or why you don  t like me ?
look , i know that i should  ve told them . i know i shouldn  t care what they think . i  m sorry .
y  know , it  ll be okay . it  ll be okay . because when they come over , i will be all charming , i will make them fall in love with me , and then we  ll tell  em .
you really think that  ll work ?
hey , i can be pretty charming , babe , i won you over , didn  t i ?
i don  t think you  ll ever get my parents that drunk

hey oh , good , ross you  re parents like me , right ?

yes , of course they like you
well monica just told me that they don  t .
yeah , they don  t like you .
do you know why ?
i dunno , maybe it  s because you  re really sarcastic . or maybe it  s cause you uh-
well if people don  t know they shouldn  t just guess

this is great , another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for .
maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin  up , eh ?
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment .
well maybe i love ya  .

dude , we were good
you  re not gonna go anywhere , you said you were gonna eat here , and you  re gonna eat here
yeah , and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very thanksgivingy .
oh , but-but it is , uh , it  s just like the first thanksgiving , when the indians and the pilgrims uh , sat down to dinner .
yeah , yeah , and the indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world

hello everybody
hi
hi

dad , mom . look look who it is it  s chandler
oh yes of course , hello chandler .
mr. and mrs. geller , you look wonderful , it is great to have you hear , let us take off your coats

whoa , snowing out there ?
no .

monica , all this food looks wonderful , you should think about doing this for a living .

ok , i have dandruff . there  s no need to laugh and point .

dad , chandler was just laughing at your joke .
my joke wasn  t funny .

rach , rach , i just remembered . i had a dream about mr. geller last night .
really ?
yeah , i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong and it  s making me look at him totally differently . y  know , i mean he used to be just , y  know  jack geller monica and ross  s dad  and now he

i dunno . y  know to me he  ll always be  jack geller , walks in while you  re changing . 

y  know dad , chandler is one of ross  s very best friends
yeah , ross sure is a great guy , y  know i  ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father .
i always thought that too . tell me , what does your father do ?

he  s the headliner of a gay burlesque show .

rach , you  re killin  us here , will ya serve the dessert already ? those drunken dancers are waiting
look at it , isn  t it beautiful ?
yeah , yeah , what is it ?
it  s a truffle . it  s got all of these layers . first there  s a layer of ladyfingers , then a layer of jam , then custard , which i made from scratch , then raspberries , more ladyfingers , then beef sauteed with peas and onions , then a little more custard , and

w-what was the one right before bananas ?
the beef ? yeah , that was weird to me , too . but then , y  know , i thought  well , there  s mincemeat pie ,  i mean that  s an english dessert , these people just put very strange things in their food , y  know . oh by the way
y-sure
and while i  m gone don  t you boys sneak a taste .
okay .

beef in a dessert ? i- no no no , there is no way

i know , and only one layer of jam ? what is up with that ?

oh my god , the pages are stuck together
chandler
oh my god , she-she made half a english trifle , and half a sheperd  s pie
oh man now she  s gonna start all over we  re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world
no , no , we will . we just won  t tell her she messed up .
just let her serve the beef-custard thing ?
yeah , it  ll be like a funny thanksgiving story
vomiting stories are funny

joey , god , your apartment is like a hundred degrees
did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear ?
no
still not hot enough

rachel ?
yeah ?
okay , look at him . look at those strong hands . oh what i wouldn  t give to be that can of condensed milk .

mom , uh , chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is .
oh , thank you chandler i just bought it .
oh , yes . well it  s very beautiful . it  s cream-colored and tight i don  t mean tight , i mean it  s not too tight , not that i was looking at-
what  s the matter with him ?
i think he  s stoned again .
what ?
what ?
dude , i need to talk to you a sec .

okay , i think i might know why my parents don  t like you .
you do ? why ?
okay , remember , we were young . hey , spring break , sophomore year , i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window .
what ? why did you do that ?
i don  t know , aheh , your  s was the first name that-that popped into my head , i  m i  m sorry . i-i didn  t think it would matter .
how could it not matter ?
how was i supposed to know we  d end up being friends after college , let alone you-you would be living with my sister ?
what about all that  friends forever  stuff ?
i don  t know , i-i was all high .

mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me
ross , i can  t believe you  d do that
the reason we haven  t told them we  re together is because they hate me , okay ? so will you fix this ?
okay , okay , i  ll tell  em it wasn  t chandler who got high . now who should i say it was ?
you it  s not like it  s a big deal you-you don  t still do it or anything
alright , alright , now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it ?

dad , please don  t pick your teeth out here alright , and if you  re gonna put your feet up , why don  t you sit on the-
monica , leave him alone

will you hurry up ? did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janine  s friends are dancers ? and that they  re going to be drinking alot ?
no , i did , but tell me again , because it  s so romantic .
well you  re whippin  so slow can  t you do it any faster ?
joey come on i don  t wanna make any mistakes , alright ? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody 's gonna be like  oh , remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ? 

so why don  t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it , alright ?
oh i am

ross , if you don  t tell them , then i will
okay , fine

ross can i talk to you for a second ?
oh , uh , can it wait a second joey ? i have to tell my parents something . no it can  t ? okay .

okay , look , i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert .
what ? what is with everybody ? it  s thanksgiving , not truth-day
look , when everyone eats that that banana-meat thing , they  re all gonna  make fun of her , do you want that ?
okay , okay , we  ll just get everyone to act like they like it . that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie
dude , they  re not objects .

just kiddin ,  i  ll talk to them , you distract rach .

hey rach , can i talk to you outside for a second ?
okay

what  s up , ross ?
so um thanksgiving . the holiday season is upon us , hm ?
yeah
and um you look nice today .
oh no . no ross , don  t do this .
what ?
i just- i don  t think us getting back together is a good idea .
eh ?
i thought this might happen today . ross , i know the holidays can be rough . y  know ? and it  s probably really hard for you to be alone right now .
you  re alone .
no , i-i live with phoebe . i mean you  re alone , alone . and i just-it  s just not the time for us . i  m sorry .
ah well , can  t blame a guy for trying

oh and okay , and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it , i learned something in acting class , try uh , rubbing your stomach or uh , or saying  mmm  and uh , oh oh and smiling , okay ?
yeah , i  m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore .

rachel , there you are come on , let  s serve that dessert already
joey , you  re gonna have to stop rushing me , you know what ? you don  t get any dessert .
really ?
no , i  m just kidding i would never do that to you okay , everybody , it  s trifle time
so , now , rach , this is a traditional english trifle , isn  t it ?
it sure is .
wow . so then did you make it with beef or eggplant ?
beef .
i can  t have any . you know i don  t eat meat . ohhh no .

alright , monica , i want you to have the first taste .
really ?

oh oh oh , wait you only got whipped cream in there ya gotta take a bite with all the layers
okay .

op wait , you dropped a pea .

well ?
mmmm it  s good
really ? how good ?
it  s so good , that i feel really selfish about being the only one who  s eating it , that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is . especially ross .

mmm .
yeah , this is so good , that i  m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert .

i  ve gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is , from monica  s room .
i  ll help you dial .

i  m gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror , as i eat it .

okay , now what was that all about ? is it-does it not taste good ? let me try it .

wha ? no no ah all gone so good maybe chandler has some left .

it tastes like feet
i like it .
are you kidding ?
what  s not to like ? custard ? good . jam ? good . meat ? gooooood .

so a bird just grabbed it , and then tried to fly away with it and , and then just dropped it on the street ?

yes , but if it  s any consolation , before the bird dropped it , he seemed to enjoy it .

rachel , come here . okay , i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap , and i had another dream about jack .
oh , phoebe , do i wanna hear this ?
i dunno , let  s see so , okay , i dreamt that we were gonna get married , and he left , becuz he had to go fight a fire . and , um , so okay , i went to a night club , and i saw him making out with a girl .
oh my god , he dream-cheated on you
yeah , but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me it was soo cool then , he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse , who , by the way , was totally coming on to me , and please , that is not gonna happen .

boy , i  m glad i wore the big belt today .
five minutes ago , a line like that would  ve floored me . now nothing . well , not nothing , i am still a woman .

ross ? let  s go .
oh yeah , about telling mom and dad , i was thinking about maybe writing a letter .
alright , you know what ? that  s it . you  ve had your chance .
wha-what ?
mom dad ross smoked pot in college
what ?
you are such a tattletale mom , dad , you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ?
yes .
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me . i  m sorry .
it was you ?
and dad , y  know that mailman that you got fired ? he didn  t steal your playboys ross did

yeah , well , hurricane gloria didn  t break the porch swing , monica did

ross hasn  t worked at the museum for a year

monica and chandler are living together

ross married rachel in vegas and got divorced again

i love jacques cousteau
i wasn  t supposed to put beef in the trifle
i wanna gooooooo
that  s alot of information to get in in thirty seconds alright joey , if wanna leave , just leave . rachel , no you weren  t supposed to put beef in the trifle . it did not taste good . phoebe , i  m sorry , but i think jacques cousteau is dead . monica ,
and we kinda figured about the porch swing .
ross , drugs ? divorced ? again ?
what happened son ?
i-i uh , i got tricked into all those things
chandler you  ve been ross  s best friend all these years , stuck by him during the drug problems . and now you  ve taken on monica as well . well , i don  t know what to say . you  re a wonderful human being .

thank you
no thank you monica , and ross i don  t know what i  m gonna do about the two of you
i  ll talk to them

you guys it was bananas , cream , and beef i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn  t feel bad
well actually , i-i didn  t eat mine . it  s still in the bathroom .
no it isn  t , i ate that .
well we left ours in monica  s bedroom .
nope , got it and i got yours too .

let me ask you , why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays ? i remember when people used to use big lights .
thats a good story , grandpa .

hey
hey
wow , monicas letting other people help decorate her tree did someone get her drunk again or ?
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about . its about being with the people that you love .
that is nice and were done . tada

i dunno what it is , it just doesnt quite feel like christmas to me .
oh , here .

see now it feels like christmas

and thats the story of the dreidle . now , some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians , who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year , symbolising lifes triumph over death . and that was like 4000 years ago .
so , pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story .

hey you guys .
hey joe whats up ?
i had to get out of the apartment . janine is like stretching all over the place . yknow , everywhere i look shes like
i can see why thats hard to resist .

wh-wh-what are you doing ?
we are looking at a playboy .
oh , i want to look too . yikes
so do you think that these picturesare , are they trying to tell a story ?
oh , yeah , sure . i mean , like in the case of this young woman , she has lost her clothes , so she rides naked on the horse , shes crying out , where are they , where are they ?
well , shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that .

oh , yeah . aw , remember the days when you used to go out to the barn , lift up your shirt , and bend over ?
yeah .
you see , now , i would date this girl . shes cute , shes outdoorsy , you know , and she knows how to build a fire . i mean , thats got to come in handy
okay , ive got a question . if you had to pick one of us to date , who would it be ?
i dont know .
me neither .
rachel .
what ?
i dont know . me neither .

you forget how many great songs heart had .
yeah .
you know , barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard .
so , you heard it , you repeated it , so that must mean you wrote it .
oh , you guys , with this joke . i gotta say , i know i cracked up , but im not even sure i got it .
what , you didnt get it ? the doctor is a monkey .

and monkeys cant write out prescriptions .

you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .
your joke ? well , i think the hef would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars .
so , you stole my joke , and you stole my money .
well , i was going to stick it in the atm , but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .
well , she is going to know that you stole the joke .
oh , what are you going to do , follow me down there ?
yeah
well , im not going to go now anyway .
okay .

here you go .
ah , gunther , i cant pay for this right now because im not working , so ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh , payin for stuff .
well , if you want , you can work here .
uh , i dont know . ya see , its just , see i was a regular on a soap opera yknow ? and to go from that to this , i just plus , id have to wait on all my friends .
okay , but the moneys good , plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want .
what ?
flexible hours .
maybe i could be a waiter . could i use the phone ?

she picked rachel . i mean , she tried to back out of it , but it was obvious . she picked rachel .
he took my joke , he took it .
its wrong . you know what else is wrong ? phoebe picking rachel .
you know who else picked rachel ? ross , and you know what else ross did ? he stole my joke . you know what ? im going to get a joke journal . yknow ? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .
thats a good idea .
yeah
do you know whats a bad idea ?
picking rachel .
thats right . did you hear something ?
maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .
its coming from the living room .

i finished my book .

hey , you guys .
hey .
oh , dont you guys look cute . you guys make such a cute couple .
monica , what are you doing ?
nothing , im just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day . remember , when you picked rachel over me ? that was funny .
i guess it was kinda funny .
it wasnt funny at all why would you do that ? why didnt you pick me ?
fine . the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre just kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch
that is completely untrue . you think im high maintenance ? okay , prove it . i want you to make a list and were going to go through it point by point
no , okay , youre right . youre easy-going . youre just not as easy-going as rachel . shes just more flexible and-and mellow . thats all .
well , people are different .
ya , you know , rachel shell do whatever you want . yknow , you can just walk all over her .
what ? wait a minute . what are you saying , that im a pushover ? im not a pushover .
oh , okay , youre not a pushover .
oh my you think im a pushover . well wait , watch this , you know what ? youre not invited to lunch . what do you think of that ? i think thats pretty strong , thats what i think . come on , monica , lets go to lunch .
you start working on that list .

i cannot believe her .
i know . where do you wanna go eat ?
oh , oh , i love that japanese place .
im sick of japanese . were not going there .
all right , wherever you wanna go is cool .

just being friendly .
joey , honey , i dont think youre supposed to go back there .
nah , its okay . right , gunther ?
dont wink at me . and put on your apron .
okay , but i dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons .
joey , do you work here ?
no .
hey , waiter .
yeah ?

joey , whats going on . what didnt you tell us you work here ?
its kind of embarrassing , yknow . i mean , i was an actor and now im a waiter . its supposed to go in the other direction .
so is your apron . youre wearing it like a cape .
i mean , the jobs easy and the moneys good , you know ? i guess im going to be hanging out here anyway . i might as well get paid for it , right ? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys .
come on , joey , i did it and it was fine .
yeah , why would it be weird ? hey , joey , can i get some coffee ?
okay , i guess it doesnt seem that weird .
seriously , i-i asked you before and you still havent gotten it .
see , now its weird again .
i think its great that you work here . youre going to make a lot of money , and heres your first tip dont eat yellow snow . . ah ha ha , 2 15 , coffeehouse .
well , you know what ? this is great . finally , i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too . let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse . first of all , the customer is always right . a smile goes a long way . and if anyone
thanks , rach . look , you guys are just terrific . yknow ? now , how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers . its all about turnover .
joey , seriously , can i get my coffee ?
oh , im sorry , ross . ill get it for you right now . and since i made you wait , ill toss in a free muffin .

phoebe . we would like to talk to you for a second .
okay .
so , maybe i am a little high maintenance . and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover . but you know what we decided you are ?
yes , we are very sorry to tell you this , but you , phoebe , are flaky .
hah
that true , i am flaky .
so , what , youre just , youre just okay with being flaky ?
yeah , totally .
well , then , im okay with being high maintenance .
yeah , and i am okay with being a pushover .
thats great . good for you guys .
i am not high maintenance
i am not a pushover
who said you were ?
you did
oh , im flaky . ill say anything .

hey , gunther . can you uh , can you cover for me ? i just got an audition .
no , im leaving to get my hair dyed .
really ? i like your natural color . come on man , its a great part . look , check it out . im the lead guys best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat . listen-listen . im sorry , that seats saved .
thats the whole part ?
okay , maybe hes not his best friend , but
okay , ill see you in an hour .
oh , man , i could totally get that part . im sorry , that seat is taken .
oh , excuse me .
no , no , i didnt mean you . but , you believed me , huh ?
i believed you were saving this seat for someone .
so , youd hire me , right ?
for what ?
exactly all right , everybody , listen up . the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour .
huh ? what ?
yeah , its for the kids . to keep the kids off drugs . its a very important issue in this months playboy . im sure you all read about it .

its my joke .
its my joke .
its my joke .
yknow , i dont think were going to settle this .
lets have monica decide .
yeah
yeah
hey mon .
mon , get out here
monica
okay , okay . you have to help us decide whose joke this is .
why do i have to decide ?
because youre the only one that can be fair .
yeah .
i cant be fair . youre my boyfriend .
yeah , but im your brother . were family . thats the most important thing in the world .
dont try to sway her . im your only chance to have a baby . okay , lets go .
well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme .
okay , chandler , you go first .
okay , i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .
oh , wait , is he the guy i met at christmas ?
can i finish my story ?
do you want me to pick you ?
see , i would never snap at you like that .

continue .
so steve said he had to go to the doctor . and steves doctors name is doctor muppy . so i said , doctor monkey ? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .
are you kidding ? okay , look . i-i studied evolution . remember , evolution ? monkey into man ? plus , im a doctor , and i had a monkey . im doctor monkey
im not arguing with that .
all right , ive heard enough . ive made my decision .

you are both idiots . the joke is not funny , and its offensive to women , and doctors , and monkeys you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit , you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world now let it go the joke sucks

its your joke .
is not .

hi , chandler . there you are .
hi , oh hi .
hey , its phoebe and rachel . um , why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?

monica is a self-sufficient , together lady . being with her has been like being on a vacation . and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit .
wow , you know what ? that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard .
really ? ive heard better .
wait , wait , he came up with that himself . tell them , chandler .
im out of words . should i just say the whole thing again ?
look , i am not high maintenance . i am not . chandler
youre a little high maintenance .
ahhh you are on my list .
im sorry . youre not easy-going , but youre passionate , and thats good . and when you get upset about the little things , i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that . and thats good too . so , they can say that youre high maintenance , but its okay , because i
i didnt even tell him to say that . . all right youre off my list .
im off the list .
phoebe , its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .
yknow , suddenly i find you very attractive .

hey , buddy boy , howd the audition go ?
not good , no . i didnt get the part , and i lost my job here , so
wow that is a bad audition .
how-how did you lose your job here ?
well , i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed . so , i went anyway , and then he fired me .
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youve been working here two days ? thats not , thats not right .
yeah , what are ya gonna do ?

id bet id still be doing my kara-tay . towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow , not doing anything else physical .
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay .
and what if i was still fat ? well , you wouldnt be dating me , thats for sure .
sure i would
oh yeah come on yeah right
what , you guys really think that im that shallow ?
no , i just think monica was that fat .
hey , imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives oh-hey , theres carol again
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ? id probably be writing for the new yorker , getting paid to be funny . but my jobs fun too i mean tomorrow , i-i dont have to wear a tie .
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch ?
what ?
merrill lynch ?
yeah , i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks .
well why didnt you take the job ?
because at that time you see , i thought everything that rhymed was true . so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks , id have to live in a box , and only eat lox , and have a pet fox .
hey , do you guys think that if all those things happened , wed still hang out ?
transcribers note this is where the opening credits are , but theyre not the usual opening credits . oh no these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened . it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and

who are these men ?
men . i guy i know .

because you shouldnt be with him . you should be with me .

yeah when you were talking about roger , that was killing me look , things like last night they dont just happen . yknow ? or at least not to me . or with the other two women , in the morning yknow i was just lying there and i couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends
chandler
i know you probably dont want to go out with me , yknow because i make too many jokes and ive never been in a serious relationship and i guess im not technically a doctor

there was just one woman , wasnt there ?
no , there were two .
including me ?
oh yeah .


it only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see one of them wont do it , but the second one will set you free tell all your hate and anger , its time to say good-bye and that is just what i will do , soon as those bastards i work for die la , la-la-la , la-la-la-la

hey , remember when i had a monkey ?
yeah .

wow i definitely did not see that one backfiring im gonna go to the bathroom .
yeah , take your time .

just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior . so it wasnt as bad as-as
ross , look , i know ive been giving you a lot of jabs and its partly because im very protective of lizzie , and partly because well , they just keep coming to me . but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many , many , many stories
not all bad .
and anyhow , im sorry i was so harsh before , but you have to understand that i still look at lizzie like shes a twelve-year-old girl .
yeah . you know what ? i know what you mean i do that too .
i beg your pardon ?
no no noti dont mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl i mean i-i have a son , whos umm six and i still think of him as a baby .

chandler , we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six .

monica , what are you talking about ?
my sweet sixteen remember , you went to third base with my cousin charlie .
ahh , third base .
its all everybody at the party could talk about
monica , yknow what ? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring
we had a characturist
oh

whenever i get married , guess who wont get to sing ? somebody named geller and somebody else named bing

monica , your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago .
and yet , here we are doing it again .
ugh , monica i dont want to steal your stupid thunder
oh please why else would you have made out with ross ?
got me .
all right , easy mimey , the moment has passed , it aint gonna happen
i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night
i swear , i never wanted any part of your night
oh , is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes ?
uh , rachel , ive been thinking . i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea . im calling it off .
why to save your dignity my man .
monica , why ? why would i ever want to take away from your night ?
i dont know i dontmaybe youre feeling a little resentful . maybe ah , maybe you thought youd get married first maybe you cant stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you
oh wow . thatyknow what ? that is so unfair . yknow what ? now i want to steal your thunder come on ross , lets go have sex

i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night
well , somebody should .

how is that ever going to happen ?
all right monica , do you want to know why i was with ross tonight ?
i know why
no you dont know why
okay why ?
because because i was sad .
what do you mean ?
look , i am soso happy for you guys , but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not . im not even close . and i dont know , maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better . and i know that thats dumb , but oh my god you were so depressed when

hello .

uh no-no , she-shes out for the night .
ohh great .
can i , can i help you with something ?
well , i dont know . are you a masseur ?
yes i am .
great dad thank you so much , ill be back to pick him up in an hour .

so chandler , youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged .
oh yeah , i should probably call them .
i remember when we first got engaged .
oh , i dont think i ever heard that story .
oh dad , really you dont need to
well , id gotten judy pregnant . i still dont know that happened .
you dont know how that happened ? your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy
what a sweet story .
well , at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party .
what ? they wanted a scary story
anyway , were really excited about our wedding plans , and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund . what ?
you tell her jack , i cant do it .
what happened ? you still have the monica wedding fund dont you ?
we have it . only now , we call it the beach house .

i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house
were sorry honey , but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself .
you bought the beach house when i was 23
which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie .
we really do feel bad about this though .
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell , so we redid the kitchen .
what about when i started dating chandler ?
well it was chandler we didnt think hed ever propose
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .
i cant believe it that there is no money for my wedding ?
we might still have some money , if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet .
it seemed like such a simple idea .
stupid jack , the word is stupid .
all right , enough i dont want to hear about it anymore good luck , chandler .

okay now , im going to touch you . ohh , thats soft .

i cant believe this . do you think that your parents could help pay for it ?
i dont know , my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding . shes saving the rest for her divorce . and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to dollywood .
well what happened at dinner ?
my parents spent the money for our wedding
my god what did you order ?
wait , but theres no money well this is terrible you guys are gonna have to get married in like a , rec. center
honey , its gonna be okay .
no no its not its not gonna be okay it sucks no swing band no lilies
no , yknow what ? its gonna be okay . i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast . yknow ? and-and you dont need , you dont need this custom-made , empire waisted , duchess , satin gown you can wear off the rack .
look , it really is gonna be okay . the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married .
do you even understand what off the rack means ?
look , why dont you just pay for it yourself ?
how ? i dont have any money .
well , i have some .
how much ?
well , close to
whoa are you kidding me ?
well what ? how-how much is it ?
its enough for wedding scenario eight .
ohh really ?
how great are you , you little saver ? i mean , the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding
ohh , you guys are so made for each other .
well , youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding ?
ah , yeah
well , come on , ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future , not just for a party .
wow hello , mr. chandler .
this is the most special day of our lives .
no , i realize that honey , but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party .
honey , umm i-i love you , but umm , if you call our wedding a party one more time , you may not get invited . okay ? listen , we could always earn more money , okay ? but uh , were only gonna get married once .
look , i understand , but i have to put my foot down . okay ? the answer is no .
you-youre gonna have to put your foot down ?
yes , i am
wow , money and a firm hand . finally a chandler i can get on board with .

uh , four , a boy , twin girls and another boy .
what else did you think about ?

well i had a great time umm , chancy on the other hand
i will tell the story it was going great . i let him win . we were bonding . he even said i could call him dad .
and what did he ask you not to call him ?
daddy . all right look , heres the story . well , we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam . i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy . so i take off my glasses and thats when in happened .

guys ?
over here .
have a seat son . hey

oh my god chandler i cant believe it
i know .
you gave my father a lap dance
why do they put so much steam in there ?
cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room .
why ? okay ? why ? wh-wh-why did that have to happen ?
come on , its not that big a deal
not that big a deal ? therethere was touching of things .
now , i know you wanted to bond with my dad , but did you really have to bond to that part ?
listen , im sure that dad doesnt care . he probably thought this was funny hell be telling this story for years
i dont want him to tell this story for years .
oh , but he will . he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .
i wasnt escaping .
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?
i was trying to help out a squirrel .
you were trying to eat it

if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off

all right , im off to see your dad .
whoa-whoa , arent you a little over dressed ?
yeah , and-and you better make sure he tips you this time .
look , i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore , and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap . and by face , i dont mean my ass .

i dont know . yknow , they didnt get us anything .
thank you
hey .

yeeeeeep yep-yep-yep-yep-yep . i remember when she took out on her dads boat she wouldnt let me help at all .
excuse me , i wanted you to help , but you couldnt move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets .
you have to respect the sea

oh yeahno , she was really nice to me , but shes in hell for sure .
well , ive tried everything . i give up . i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies . i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe . kids love that right .

youre lewis posin .
who ?
lewis posin he was my best friend in fifth grade , and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no . do you know why ?
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom ?
no but because he thought i was to faaaaa . and every time i think about it , it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade yknow , i-i really think that you should apologize to julie .
what ? are you kidding ? that was like 16 years ago .
no , i know . but yknow what ? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .
okay , i will do it . but i have to warn you this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with

okay , all right , this is how its going to work . were gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10 , 1 being the highest .
no , 10 is the highest .
why is 10 the highest ?
because its the highest . okay , rachel youre up first . situation no. 1 youre with monica , the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet . go
i dont want to marry chandler
okay , uh
ive got cold feet .
its gonna be okay
no , one man for the rest of my life ? i dont know if i can do it this means ill never get to sleep with joey
look monica , getting cold feet is very common . yknow , its-its just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler . and also , i ran out on a wedding . you dont get to keep the gifts .
very good drawing on your own experience , i like that

oh thats nice .
thank you . thank you very much . umm , ive known them separately and ive known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love . so i would like to raise my glass to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark
wow . good speech .
yeah , it really was

thats why you broke up with me ?
you-you-you didnt know that . well , i guess my work here is done

well yknow what ? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her , her vegetarian , voodoo , goddess circley shower
rach , its gonna be okay you guys are the best
boy i tell ya , that judging stuff took a lot out of me .
yeah ?
yeah i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch .
why-why would i care about that ?
no reason , im just saying that uh thats where ill be .

as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself . i think that im going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do .
why dont you just stop doing stupid things ? then you wouldnt have to apologize .
i would really love it if could do both .
all right , ii have to ask .
what ?
are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again ?
what ?
well , you broke up with julie grath how much weight could she have gained ?
a hundred and forty-five pounds .
in one year ? my god what did she eat ? her-her family thats not the point .
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody , but i was 15
well thats not the only time this was an issue . you remember when umm , you spent thanksgiving with us ? you called me fat .
okay . okay , now wait a minute that was totally different .
how ?
you were not supposed to hear that i said that behind you back
what if i have babies , okay ? i mean im gonna look different . im okay with that , but im not sure that you are
look you have to realize i dont think of you as a thin , beautiful woman . see this is one of things that i can apologize for later look , what i mean is youre monica okay ? and i am in love with monica .
keep going .
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you .
even if i shrink down to two inches tall ?
id carry you around in my pocket .
i love you .
skidmarks still got a way with the ladies .

hi pheebs .
hi
hi i just want to apologize . im really sorry i was a baby .
thats ridiculous rachel , we were all babies once . oh , you mean today .
yeah . yeah , and yknow you-you deserve to win . and-and yknow i was thinking about it , if-if youre monicas maid of honor that means i get to be yours .
oh yeah
yeah oh , umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together , yknow just in case
oh thats so sweet thanks .
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves . and-and ohh god this is funny , look , this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride . and look , she made me carry her train , which was weird because i was wonder woman . oh and heres a little
ohh .
and umm , vintage handkerchiefs yknow cause , people cry at weddings . im just gonna grab a couple of these .
this stuff is great
oh , i forgot this was in here . umm , this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monicas something borrowed and its blue . yeah
yknow rach , i think that , i think you should be monicas made of honor .
you do ? why ?
because i think it means more to you .
but pheebs , yknow you earned it .
its fine . i mean , this is something that youve been thinking about since you were what , 14 ?
no , i was ten . i just developed early .
man alive
hey , whats going on ?
hey
well , we just decided that rachel is gonna be your maid of honor .
ohh , wow thats great oh wow we really have to start planning i have , i have a lot of really specific ideas we should probably get together like four times per week . you can come over to my place well get together before work what do you say , 6 30 , my place ? im so
yeah okay , you laugh now , but shes gonna be yours .

great nap .
it really was .

dude what the hell are you doing ? god
excuse me .

hey everybody happy thanksgiving
no , no , no . no-no-no .
shhhh
what , are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?
no , we 're playing this game i learned at work . you have to name all the states in six minutes .
what ? that 's like insanely easy
now , that 's a lot harder than it sounds . you always forget at least one , or in some cases fourteen .
it 's a stupid game and i wasn 't playing against other people , so technically i didn 't lose .
what ? you forgot fourteen states ?
nobody cares about the dakotas .

oh , okay , time 's up
all right , i got 48 .
oh that 's not bad , pheebs ?
oh , i got tired of naming states . so i decided to list the types of celery , and i have one regular celery .
okay , so rachel 's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables , joey ?
say hello to the new champ of chandler 's dumb states game .
wow , how many have you got ?
fifty-six

hey how is new england not a state ? huh ? they have a sports-team
does south oregon have a sports-team ? there you go .

how come we have one extra place setting ?
'cause you invited your assistant .
oh , right . sorry . but tag 's not coming his girlfriend came into town , so he 's spending thanksgiving with her .
oh why didn 't you tell me ? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .
well , i was going to , but then i figured , you know you 're food is so delicious and perfect , you can never have too many of those pumpkin things .
now you think i wouldn 't enjoy that , because it is so fake , but i still do .
regular celery oh , i already have that .
done with time a-to-spare .
oooh that may be a new world 's record
you know , i hate to lecture you guys , but it 's kinda disgraceful , that a group of well-educated adults and joey can 't name all the states . did you ever see a map , or one of those round , colorful things called a globe ? hmm ?
uh , magellan ? you got 46 states .
what ? that 's impossible .
46 . wow who 's well educated now , mr. i-forgot-ten-states ?
all right , i 'm out of oven space . i 'm gonna turn on joey 's . please , watch him do not let joey eat any of the food
i am only one man okay ross , time is up
no , just give me another minute .
look ross , if you don 't know them by now , you will never know them , okay ? that is the beauty of this game . it makes you want to kill yourself .
this-this is crazy i can do this all right , uhh , i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .
okay , but if you can 'tno dinner
you 're on
all right . don 't look at my list , ross , cause there 's a lot on there that you don 't have .
hey , did you guys know , that your oven doesn 't work ?
but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay , right ?
ross , i 'm gonna use yours , okay ?
pshhshhh
chandler ? can you give me a hand ?
sure , and joey do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .
don 't worry , chandler , it 's not a globe of the united states .

hey you guys i 'm gonna go out and take a walk .
phoebe , why is your bag moving ?
oh , it 's not
seriously , it 's moving
what the hell is in there ?
it 's just my knitting that 's all yes i knit this . i 'm very good .

rosss apartment is nice how come we don 't hang out here more often ?
i don 't know . maybe it 's because it smells a little weird . it 's like old pumpkins or something .
that 's my pie
which smells delicious
uh-oh uh-oh
what ?
we left joey alone with the food yep yep , i knew it there he is feeding stuffing to a dog

hi geller-bing residence . how can i help ?
phoebe , why is there a dog in our apartment ?
i 'm sorry , who 's this ?
phoebe , there 's a dog sitting on my couch
tell her , i 'm allergic , and i will sue
no , there 's no dog here ?
yes there is he 's black and white and shaggy and he 's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel 's hand .
oh my god where are you ?
i 'll be right there
they 're here already ? how are they doing this ?
hi tag what are you doing here ?
i , uh , wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good .
well , sure come in well , what-what happened to your girlfriend ?
we kinda broke up this morning .
oh , i 'm sorry .
yeah , so she went back to ohio .
ohio thank you

huh where is the dog ?
what dog ? there-there 's no dog here .
yeah that dog left
phoebe phoebe , open up
there 's no dog in here .

phoebe , we can hear the dog barking
no that 's just me coughing oh , good , there you are listen , um , i have a dog in my room .
what is it doing here ?
well , i 'm watching it for some friends who went out of town . wait . hello , my name is clunkers . may i please stay with you nice people ?
oooh , i wish she could stay here , but chandler is allergic
extremely allergic , okay ? if i 'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes , my throat will just close up
that 's odd , cause this dog 's been living here for the past 3 days
really ?
chandler , if that dog 's been here that long , and you haven 't had a reaction , maybe you 're not allergic to this dog ?
well , it still has to go , right ?
why ?
okay , it 's um
don 't do it
don 't do what ?
i have to okay ? it 's time okay , i hate dogs .
what ?
are you crazy ?
are you out of your mind ?
why ?
told ya .
they are needy , they are jumpy , and you can 't tell what they are thinking , and that scares me a little bit .
right , they are scary . ahh , she just ate a treat out of my hand
wait a minute . do you not like all dogs ? i mean , not even puppies ?
is there a puppy here ?
you don 't like puppies ?
okay , you are new
look , chandler , i told you , never tell anyone about this dog thing . it 's like ross not likin ice cream .
you don 't like ice cream ?
it 's too cold .
okay , it 's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .
it hurts my teeth .
and i don 't wanna say this , i don 't you guys to hate me , but uh , i don 't think , i can be around that dog anymore . okay , so either the dog goes , or i go . oh my god

how can i not get this ? i 'm a college professor i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s.
1250 .
damn , i forgot you were here .
all right . we 're gonna take clunkers to rosss . we 'll be back in a minute .
oh , wait before you guys go , can i just ask you a question ?
yeah .
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend , what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?
oh , i 'd say about a month .
really ? i 'd say 3 to 4 .
half hour .
interesting .
when it 's your assistant , i would say never .
all right , rach , the big question is , does he like you ? all right ? because if he doesn 't like you , this is all a moo-point .
huh . a moo-point ?
yeah , it 's like a cow 's opinion . it just doesn 't matter . it 's moo .
have i been living with him for too long , or did that all just make sense ?
please , don 't listen to joey , okay . would you look at him ? he-hes obviously depressed . he 's away from his family he 's spending thanksgiving with strangers . what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .
you 're right , i 'm sorry . thank you . okay , that 's what i 'm gonna do .
fine take their advice . no one ever listens to me . when the package is this pretty , no one cares what 's inside .

hey
hey .
how are you holding up ?
not bad .
yeah ? i 'm sorry about your girlfriend .
thanks .
so were you guys together a long time ?
a year . on and off . i kinda thought we 'd end up together . i don 't anymore .
now that she broke up with you ?
yeah .
yeah . hmmmm .
it 's weird . i always used to assume , that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given . but lately it 's like what if it 's not . do you ever have that feeling ?
noyeah , all the time , constantly . it 's terrifying . but you know that i figure itit has to work out .
why ?
because , uhit has to .
you have all the answers , don 't you ?
yeah , i know , i do . i really do .
hey , thanks for talking to me .
well , what is a boss for ? hug it out
all right , he likes you back huh ? told ya , you should go for it
what ?
street noise drowned any of that out ? no , all right , i see you later , okay

what did joey say ? i like you back ?
uh , yeah , well , see , he joey knows , that i 'm-i 'm very insecure about my back and , andyou 're hugging me , so obviously you are not repulsed by it , yeah
wait-wait a minute that doesn 't make any sense .
no ? all right , here 's the truth um , joey said what he said , because um , i 'm attracted to you .
wow .
yeah , i admit it . i have a crush on you , and uh , and , and i know that 's crazy because we work together , and-and nothing could ever happen , and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable . which is why it would be
oh my god those guys are stealing my car
what ?
right there that 's my car hey
okay , that 's gonna take them a minute . do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest ?
i can 't believe this
wait , we still have time to talk and theyre-they 're not even in the car yet oh look , there they go , okay .

okay phoebe , we should probably go back now .
please don 't leave me , i 'll be lonely .
stop it . stop okay let 's go . we can be strong .
yeah , okay .

oh my god did you hear that ? she said monica oooh , i can 't leave her
you know if you want , we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn 't even know .
that 's not gonna work .
i 've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea . he 's not so smart .
hey i didn 't know either .
yeah , but you kinda knew that something was going on , didn 't you ?
yeah , i knew .

where 's chandler ?
here i am .
wash your hands
how did youknow ?

hey what 's she doing back here ?
relax , ross . she 's not made of ice cream
hey look , phoebe . i , uh , i laid out the states geographically
no , no , we don 't really have time for this right now . okay , we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom .
yeah , but , but look what i 'm
see , this is exactly what we do not have time for .
where 's monica ?
um , in phoebe 's room . you can 't go in there .
why not ?

monica 's crying . she 's very upset about this whole clunkers thing .
well , i , i should go in there .
no . no , no . she doesn 't want to see you right now .
why not ?
because you sent away the dog
this is ridiculous .
oh , is it ? is it ? look , when monica and i were kids , we had a dog named rover . and , uh , one day , my dad decides , he doesn 't like dogs . so monica and her friendphyllistake away the dog . and that was the last time we ever saw him
okay , i 'm in my sweat pants . bring on the food what 's the matter ?
monica 's all upset , because i sent clunkers away .

if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building , why not get him something a little bit more subtle , like a wrecking ball , or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway ?
it 's not just the drum noise . every five minutes , joey throws his sticks in the air , and i have to hear , oh my eye oh god , my eye i mean , it is so annoying .
yes , thank you . you see , this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .
phoebe , you got joey drums to annoy rachel , so she wouldn 't wanna live there anymore ?
maybe on some level .

joey , yknow that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air .
what is rock n roll about that ?
hey , joey , i got you another present .
oh wait , before you tell me what it is okay , what is it ?
it 's atarantula oh god rachel , look , i 'm sorry . what was i thinking giving joey this big , gross , scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage ?
what are you talking about ? i love them yeah , i had a tarantula when i was a kid . but it-it died , because my cat ate it . and then , then my cat died . but joey , isn 't this cool ?
is it on me ? i feel , i feel like it 's on me i got , hey
oh , isn 't that adorable ? joey is afraid of the tarantula .
ah , yeah , he 's so adorable , god , he 's just so much fun , joey is the best , i 'm glad you 're having so much fun here .
what ? wait-wait a minute , what ? phoebe , what 's the matter ?
our apartment is ready .
and that makes you angry because
because you would rather live here with joey .
where did you get that ?
monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here . and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that .
phoebe ?
hm ?
did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment ? honey , if you wanted to do that , you might as well just gotten him a fish , you know how fish freaked me out
fish
it wouldn 't have mattered anyway , phoebe , you and i are , are gonna live together , we 're roommates that 's the deal .
yes , but i wanted you to want to live with me , but okay , if you 're having so much fun over here

i 'm the holiday armadillo i 'm a friend of santa 's and he sent me here to wish you a merry christmas
what happened to santa , holiday armadillo ?
santa was unavailable so close to christmas .
wow , come in , have a seat . you must be exhausted coming all the way fromtexas .
texas ?
that 's right , ben . i 'm santa 's representative for all the southern states . and mexico but , santa sent me here to give you these presents , ben . maybe the lady will help me with these presents .

wow thanks
you 're welcome , ben . merry christmas , ooh , and happy hanukkah
are you for hanukkah , too ? because i 'm part-jewish .
you are ? me , too
because armadillos also wandered in the desert ?
you wanna wander in the hall ? ooh , hey ben , what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ?
cool
yeah
come on ben .

years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees
ho , ho , ho merry christmas
santa
hey
what are you doing here , santa ?
well , i 'm here to see my old buddy ben . what are you doing here , weirdturtle-man ?
i 'm the holiday armadillo , your part-jewish friend . you sent me here to give ben some presents . remember ?
what ?
did you bring me any presents , santa ?
you bet i did , ben , put it there well , it would have worked this time , if his hands weren 't so damn small ho , ho , ho
okay ben , why don 't you come open some more presents , and santa , the armadillo , and i have a little talk in the kitchen ? there 's a sentence , i never thought i 'd say .

what are you doing ?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume , so i borrowed one from a guy at work
thank you , but , but you gotta leave .
why ?
because , i 'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah , and , and you 're-youre wrecking it .
but i didn 't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly .
i 'm sorry , chandler but this , this is really important to me .
fine , i 'll give the suit back .

hey , you think , you can keep it another night ?
santa ? really ?
yes , is that okay ?
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?
no .
then it 's okay
okay ben , santa has to go . say good-bye
no why does he have to go ?
because , if santa and the holidayarmadillo ? are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode . merry christmas
no why can 't the armadillo leave ? i want santa
fine , i-i give up . santa , santa can stay .
well , i 'll stay , but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah . ben , will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah ?
okay , santa

all right , it 's time for the story of hanukkah . years and years ago , there were these people called the maccabees .

merry christmas

oh my god
what ?
okay , remember uh , remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms ?

yeah ?
do you really not know where im going with this ? it left its one huge room
oh no oh wow
see ?
well , i guess well just have to put the wall back up .
you cant , because of the new skylight

yknow im-im sensing that um , my grandmother would not be comfortable with that .
oh yeah ? startin to feel her again there are we ?
a little bit , yeah .
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone ?
you heard her too ? you have the gift
phoebe , its okay . i like living with joey .

oh me too .
i know . oh-oh , wait did you hear that-hear that ? listen , im gettin something from your grandmother , she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair ?
no , i do not hear that .

and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day , burned for
eight whole days .
thats right , and thats why we celebrate hanukkah today . the end .
awesome
yeah ?
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt .

hey , you have got to try this cheesecake .
oh , yknow i 'm not that much of a sweet tooth . i wow . my god , so creamy . oh my god , this is the best cheesecake i have ever had . where did you get this ?
it was at the front door . when i got home . somebody sent it to us .
chandler , this is not addressed to you . this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs . thief .
ino i didn 't read the box before i opened it . and you can 't return a box after you 've opened the box .
why , why not ?
because it 's too delicious .
chandler , you stole this cheesecake . that is wrong .
no-no-no it is going to be okay , because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate , mommas little bakery . i feel terrible , im a horrible , horrible , horrible person .
oh , im sorry what ?

all right , i should get going , big day a work . yknow im in a coma ? today , they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead .
so
ah-ah-ah mr. smartie pants , its just not my character thats not brain dead . hey , so pheebs , we still on for tonight ?
absolutely
ill see you at 8 00 .
okay .
oh , whats at 8 00 ?
oh , i have dinner plans with joey . we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys .
wow , did not know that may i say how lovely you look today ?
duly noted .
thanks . oh so for tomorrow , do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what ?
what are you talking about ?
cousin frannies wedding , its tomorrow night .
you were invited ?
no .
my god , i cant believe this i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited , but i thought that was it i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable
well , maybe since the age of 9 , frannies made some new friends .
well l-look okay , its probably just a mistake . let me call aunt sheryl okay ? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail .
yeah , well you call her and tell her that yknow when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times , okay ? and if i hadnt have stopped her , there probably wouldnt even be a wedding to go too .
yknow , she tried to undress me too .
i used to undress my cousin glenn .

joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet ?
umm , i think hes still out . whats wrong ?
well , ill tell you rachel karen green , i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note .
pheebs , cant make it , got a date . talk to you later . big daddy . big daddy ?
oh thats a nickname we were trying out .
hey , yknow what nickname never caught on ? the ross-a-tron
hey
oh heres joseph francis
oh-wha-ho what are you middle naming me for ? i left you a note
so what ? that doesnt give you the right to ditch me
hey , you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex
phoebe hes right , that is the rule .
i dont accept this rule . when me make plans , i expect you to show up . okay , i cant just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better yknow boyfriends and girlfriends come and go , but this is for life
wow im so sorry i had no idea it would bother you this much .
well , it does .
okay , can i-can i make it up to you ? huh ? im sorry . how about uh , dinner tomorrow night ? ill pay for myself
okay , you wore me down .
hey joe , while youre over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron ?
the rossis that back ?

hi
another cheesecake came they delivered it to the wrong address again
so just bring it back downstairs , whats the problem ?
i cant seem to say goodbye .
are you serious ? chandler , we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more ?
well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay ?
it was cheesecake . it was fine . it had a buttery , crumbly , graham cracker crust , with a very rich yet light , cream cheese filling wow my whole mouth just filled with saliva
yknow what ? forget it we are just hungry we have not had lunch we are just light-headed so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .
yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted .
good idea . where do you want to go to lunch ?
mommas little bakery , chicago , illinois .

awww mel torme died .
joey , that papers like a year old
aw does that mean the sam goodys sale is over ?
hey .
hey .
hey .
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasnt a mistake . ahh , theres-theres limited seating in the hall .
limited seating ? i am just one tiny person
well yeah , but she doesnt know that . i mean , the last time she saw you-you wouldve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling .
limited seating oh , that is such a lame excuse thats not the reason shes not inviting me
oh whats the big deal ? i wasnt even invited to the ceremony , just the reception . and-and yknow what ? if it makes you feel any better , joan and i will just make an appearance and then , and then well-well leave early as a sign of protest .
joan ?
yeah , joan tedeski my date . shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department . tall , very beautiful , and despite what some people say , not broad backed
wait a minute , you got ross gellar and guest ? i wasnt invited and you got and guest ?
uh-uh , excuse me , i do have to interrupt on rosss behalf . i-i think the rule applies here yknow , since she has a chance to get on broad back
not broad backed
wait a minute , yknow , youre bringing me
what ? i cant cancel on joan
why not ?
becdid you not hear me ? shes an assistant professor in the linguistics department , okay ? theyre wild why do you want to come anyway ?
because shes my cousin . i mean , we grew up together were family yknow ? well thats important to me .
okay , all right , ill take you . ill go call joan .
aww thats nice . family should be there , huh ? this is her wedding , happiest day of her life .
well see .

well , thank you for lunch .
what ? wait a minute , i didnt pay , i thought you paid
so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore . do you see what i see ?
its still there
mrs. braverman must be out .
she could be out of town . maybe shell be gone for months .
by then , the cheesecake may have gone bad . we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake .
no that could kill her .
well , we dont want that .
no so were protecting her .
but we should take it .
but we should move quick .
why ?
because i think i just heard her moving around in there .

hey , yknow if you want to pick up some extra cash ? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing .
oh thats a great idea . youre really good on the phone .
yeah and yeah , and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had . yknow , i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much .
what ?
oh yeah , like you never called

so basically this is very easy . you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can .
okay , i can do that oh , by the way , i love my office .
why dont we do a trial run .
oh okay . umm , all right . hi , this is phoebe from empire office supplies , can i speak to your supply manager please ?
im the supply manager .
umm , okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs .
we dont need any toner .
oh okay , well im sorry to bother you . bye-bye . yeah youre right , this is easy .
okay , what was wrong with that call ?
oh well , all rightum , no offense , but you were kind of rude .
theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner , but thats okay because whatever they say , you can find the answer to it here in this script .
oh .
so , i think youre ready to sell toner , do you have any last questions ?
no . oh wait yes i do , i do have one question . what is toner ?

joey joe full bag . beers still cold . something terrible mustve happened here oh no-no-no-no-no-no stevie , i was never here

dad ?
im here
hey
hi . god , it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work .
dad , we-we cant believe youre selling the house .
well , its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling .
lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here .
im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore .
oh , thats okay , i cant wait to see everything again all of the memories
well , i dont know whats in the boxes down here , but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic .
i used to love to play restaurant .
yeah , not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater .
hey , it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies
so , i think youre boxes are over here .
wow great wait , dad who-whos cigarettes are these ?
i dont know . they-they must be your mothers , but please , please dont ask her . ill throw these away .

francette ? what is she ? a couch ?

poor thing . cut down in her prime .
joey , the new chair will be here in an hour . maybe we should actually move rosita out of here . yknow , start the heeling process ?
well , i guess youre right . maybe , maybe ill take her down to the incinerator . its gonna be so said , and kinda cool . shes heeled
thats weird .
no its not weird , its a miracle
its not a miracle joey im sure theres some explanation .
oh there is if you want something enough and your heart is pure , wondrous things can happen
joey , i really dont
can you tell me how this happened ?
well no .
miracle
no , yknow what ? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it or something
someone like anangel ?
thats right joey , the chair angel came in and heeled your chair .
get your non-believer ass outta my chair

well , shell understand right ? its not like i did it on purpose .
dad that wont matter to her . look , all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is , is growing new stuff see , this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her .
oh my god , does she really thinks that ?
well , can you blame her ?
well i dont know , i-i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously , you were a medical marvel the doctor said your mother could
dad , dad i dont want to hear about it .
really ?
well , not right now . okay look , monica came here for some memories and damnit , were gonna give her some okay , grabgrab some empty boxes . okay ? well-well take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers well-well put em in their .

my chair heels itself .

earl , youre not hearing me all im saying is that youre not alone all right ? everybody hates the people they work with
hey guy
wait , what was that ? that sounded like someone being nice to you .
no thats just the hey guy guy . he says that to everybody hes the worst id like to take him with me
all right so earl , lets just forget about the people at the office , okay ? there-theres gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for what about-what about your family , your friends , or maybe your girlfriend ?
yeah right
oh sorry , boyfriend
oh no .
no , whatever anything
the hey guy guy hey guy
yeah , hes gotta go .
okay , i should , i should probably be getting back to my thing now . see ya .

okay . so , which boxes are mine ?
well , these . these are yours right here .
okay . oh a coloring book
yeah . yeah , oh you loved that thing . you always had it with you . you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book .
really ? wow it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines .
nu-uh
oh , an old glove ?
oh , yeah you loved that glove you took it every place you went . you never went any place without that glove .
wow look at this i cant believe i even fit into this shirt oh , this is yours .
oh , i dont know how that got in there .
this isnt mine . hey , this isnt , this isnt my stuff ugh , ross these are your boxes where are my boxes ?
umm , your boxes are umm
what ?
dad ?
well , the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes . im sorry .
just mine ?
im afraid so .
so why-why wasnt rosss stuff ruined ? and if you say the words medical marvel im going to easy bake your head
well , i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche .
so wait , rosss stuff is fine , but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water
there was also leaves and guk and stuff .
i cant believe this
screw it im having one .

hey chandler
hey
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines , has a rolling massage , and speakers in the head rest ?
yeah , id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore .
well what if i told you , you can do it in my apartment ?
are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete ? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year ?
i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000 .
thats awesome thats great what made you do it ?
well , its a long story , but umm i broke joeys chair
whoa-whoa-whoa you broke joeys chair ?
yeah .
i thought i broke joeys chair thats why i replaced it with mine
ohhhhh . thats how it got fixed
well , what did you think , that-that elves came in and fixed it ?
noo angels .
im gettin my chair back
what ? wh-hey

well , it looks like it wasnt heeled after all yeah so , i guess this chair is mine now
joey you broke my chair
your chair ?
yeah , he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
so , there was no miracle ?
no joe , no miracle .
oh no this is devastating my faith is shaken . im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life .
uh-huh nice try , but you dont get that chair anymore all right ? that is my chair now you can sit on my lap no i take that back
i think i should get the chair

how do you figure ?
because you broke a chair and you broke a chair the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair , is me
no-no-no this chairs not going anywhere .
well , wheres the logic in that ?
the logic is , that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing

thats right
what are you guys ? like a gang or something ?

yeah we are

were the cobras

excuse me can you tell me where i can find earl ? hes the supply manager around here .
sorry , i dont know any earl .
im right here
earl im phoebe .
phoebe ? the lady who sells toner ?
umm , look it , you-you cant kill yourself .
look , um i really appreciate your coming down
no-no i cant i cant let you do it
why ?
because it was fate that made me call you today
i thought it was toner .
no think about it okay ? this isnt even my regular job okay ? and my first day on the job , youre my first call and-and somebody else mightve hung up on you , but i wouldnt do that because i know about this stuff . my mom killed herself .
really ?
yes .
how ?
im not gonna give you tips look dont you see that this-thisthis all came together so that i could stop you from doing this .
couldnt it just be a coincidence ?
no , its fate
it doesnt really seem like enough to be fate .
oh . well umm , okay heres a weird thing . my mother was also a supply manager .
im actually the office manager .
oh my god so was she and get this , okay ? your-your name is earl , right ? her name was pearl , p-earl .
well , was there anything else ?
sure umm , where are you from ?
philadelphia .
oh my god so was she oh , ive got-ive got goose bumps .
really ?
well , yknow im wearing layers and its warm .
yeah-yeah .
but ifno look , okay . these jerks might not care about you , but the universe does and that says a lot
did you hear that ? i dont need you guys to care about me because the universe cares the whole universe i really wished theyd care just a little bit though .
yknow , i dont-i dont think its you . this is a freaky place . hey guys oh no , its you .
yeah .

oh , this terrible eve rything is destroyed look at this . it obviously meant enough for me to save it , and i dont even know what it is ohh , its still soft . what do you think this is ?

how are you honey ?
how do you think i am ? youve wrecked all my childhood memories . you love ross more than me . and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face

oh let me guess , and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother .
as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years . i love this plan i wanna marry this plan
if you could do that , id marry the hippity-hop .
so , if i wanna have my kid when im 35 , i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 . which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes oh wait , but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant
really that long ? look all you want , its happening
no , so i dont have to get married until im 33 thats three years , thats three whole yearsoh , wait a minute though . ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding , and id like to know the guy for a year , year and a half before we get engaged which means i
which is fine because you just turned twenty-eight
no ross , no it is not fine eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry

do you mind telling us what it is ?
sorry , im kinda keeping this one on the q.t.
well , whatever it is , i hope it involves winking .
hey
hey
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today , and
what is dool ?
days of our lives . anyway , youre not gonna believe it my character is coming out of his coma
oh
thats great
and-and-and not only that , im gettin a new brain
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life
wait , what do you mean youre getting a new brain ?
oh well , theyre killing off one of the characters on the show , and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body .
what ? a brain transplant ?
yes , its a highly controversial procedure .
its ridiculous
well , i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months .
its winter , they are fewer people on the street .
who are they killing off ?
uh cecilia monroe , she plays jessica lockhart .
noo
shes my favorite character on dool .
nice .
she is so good at throwing drinks in peoples faces , i mean i dont think ive ever seen her finish a beverage .
and the way she slaps all the time
oh
wouldnt you love to do it just once ?
dont do it .
cecilia monroe man , what a great actress .
oh , tell me about it . and shes been on the show forever , its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes .
yeah-yeah , help me out here , when you come out of the brain transplant , you are going to be her ?
yes , but in drake remorays body . why is this so hard for you to get ? i thought you were a scientist

rach , so , that guy there . straight or gay ?
well , i 'd have to say gay .
yeah ? why ?
well mainly because he 's kissing that other guy .
oh no not that guy there . that guy right there .
oh yeah he 's too cute to be straight .
ohh knockers will help us figure it out .
all right , straight , and not subtle .
ohh , he left his cell phone .
oh , well , we can hand it to gunther and he 'll put it in lost and found .
or we could use it to call china . see how those guys are doing .
what if , um , if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love . i mean wouldn 't that be a great story ? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .
yeah that does sound great . i 'm going to get the phone .
what ? wait whywhy do you get the story ?
i don 't know . i haven 't been out on a date in so long .
phoebe , you had a date three days ago .
that wasnt a date that was , that was just friends getting together having sex .
okay . okay , see ? i get the phone .

so you like the nachos uh ? myself im partial to
im 16 .
see you in 2003 .
youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show . they dont know exactly when its going to happen , but apparently going to be very soon and thats it .
im so sorry . look , if it was up to me you would never leave the show .
yeah , thanks .
no i mean it i cant believe they would do this to you and to your fans i mean they are going to be devastated heart broken they love you so much
oh youre right . thank you whats your name again ?
joey .
joey , well thank you . that is so sweet . oh , excuse me .
it wasnt my decision
im having a conversation here you were saying ?
uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i , that i came up to you before was because well , im really nervous about-about being you . yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character . yknow ? help me keep jessica alive . please ?
all right joey , i will help you . not because i-i owe it to this stupid show , but because i owe it to jessica .
oh thats great oh thank you so much
youre so welcome .
hey now , ive been watching some tapes , hows this ? jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again ever
is that supposed to be me ?
yeah .
yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent .
i can do an english accent ? that babys going on my resume

well , i feel like a snack
do you want some shortbread ? eh thats scottish like you are .
oh no thanks . i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage .
what ?
well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings . anyway , lots of bad memories .
oh well , it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh , rediscover its scottish roots .
no no-no theyre not . theyre still very angry but yknow chandler is also half-swedish . you know what the swedish people are famous for ? sitting down and being quiet .
well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more
you can not play bagpipes at the wedding
how did you know about that ?
we heard you play all the way from your apartment
were you the ones called the cops ?
thats not really important right now . what is important is while we appreciate the gesture , we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .
why not ?
because we hate them .
come on thats not fair i mean you havent even heard me play
we have heard you play .
no , youve heard my practice . okay ? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want . and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either . but uh , lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a we bit o celebration .

so , the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence . so , when jessica enters a room for instance , she owns everything and every person in that room . you try .
okay all right
no , he already knows that he owns everything in the room hes not finding it out for the first time so , try it again .
okay . okay .
right . hes not angry at the room either . try it again , he owns it he owns the room . it is his . he owns , owns , owns , owns the room he owns it all right , its a little weird , but its getting better . oh well , im gonna miss this woman
oh wellhey-hey maybe , maybe uh , maybe this is a good thing . yknow ? itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up , play different characters . youre so talented .
i am . i am , but i dont know you know . an actor of a certain age is not that easy .
hey thats not true look at uh , look at angela lansbangelina jolie
i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in , but yknow i just got so comfy here and ohh , i turned down some amazing work
like-like what ?
well , lets just say if i left 15 years ago , the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
wow
but well now , nows a different time for me .
oh hey come on , dont-dont-dont do this umm , look let-let me tell you something , okay ? now when i watch you do a scene , im thinking , boy , she-she is a great actress uh but-but , i am also thinking , she is hot
you think im hot ?
you own the room . we should probably get-get uh
oh yeah-yeah , we should get the so when jessica kisses a man , she usually puts umm , both her hands on the mans face .
yeah-yeah , i noticed that is that cause shes so passionate ?
no its because that way the camera only sees her do you wanna try it ?
yeah okay .
that was good , that was really good . but i-i think your hands maybe a little off , they should be maybe right like

hey hey

hi its tom , im here to pick up the phone .

yeah . but a part of me also cant wait til its over . chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding .
a no sex pact huh ? i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america .
hey phoebe , will you give me a hand ?

i gotta make up the guest bedroom . hey , cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days .

i know youre planning my surprise bridal shower .
well okaywell dont ruin it just play along at least
okay . sorry .
oh my god we have to throw her a shower ?

hey what did you decide to do about the movie ?
i dont know its not like its porn this is a serious , legitimate movie . yknow ? and the nudity is really important to the story .
thats what you say about porn .
youre right . maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back .
no no you should a lot of major actors do nude scenes i mean the chance to star in a movie ? come on
well thats true . and i am only naked in one scene . plus it sounds really great . my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl . who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm . so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other .
plus , everyones gonna see your thing .

well when can we have this shower ?
she has got so much going on we-we have only two options . we have friday
well thats only two days away . what is the other option ?
yesterday
well if we make it yesterday , woo-hoo were done
oh my god phoebe , this is impossible we cant do this by friday we have to find a place . we have to invite people we have to get food theres just too much to do its impossible we cant do it we cannot do it we cannot do it
rachel , calm down
okay . im sorry . youre right , youre right .
just calm down woman
phoebe , i already , i already did .
oh okay . all right , then i need to calm down a little .
okay . okay . i think we can do this if we just get organized . all right ? we have two days to plan this party . we just need to make fast decisions okay ? all right , where are we gonna have it ?
uh , here . what time ?
4 oclock . food ?
finger sandwiches and tea .
ooh great very monica .
and chili
ah you went one too far . uh , flowers or balloons ?
both
were paying for this yknow .
neither .
okay . umm , what should we do for the theme ?
lusts of the flesh .
what ?
i dont know . a cowboy theme ?

hey
hey
yknow im-im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .
oh boy me too
yknow i was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
yeah ?
technically we could have sex again . what do you think , bossy and domineering ?
the wedding is off , sloppy and immature
thats me come on
okay . but wait , we cant . my cousin cassie is in the guest room , were supposed to have lunch .
well get rid of her , obsessive and shrill .
shrill ? the wedding is back on

i thought i heard voices . you must be chandler .
hi nice to meet you
nice to meet you too .
so , are you ready to go ?
yeah .

chandler
ill be right with you .

cassie needs to stay at your place .
whatwhy ?
because purvry perverson over here cant stop staring at her .
what ? chandler shes our cousin
i was not staring at her . okay ? i was just listening intently . its called being a good conversationalist . watch . say something .
you were staring about eight inches south of there .
fine , she can stay at my place . by the way , what-what does cassie even look like now .
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn .
umm , so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding ?
wafer thin ice

hey , im back
hi-hi joey .
uh so , will-will i be reading the same scene again ?
actually , i tried to call to you . you didnt need to come down here today .
oh great yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part , but whatever yknow , thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie good day
wait joey you didnt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it .
and scene huh ? wasnt that fun ? we did a little improv there . yeah okay so you-you-you-you were saying ?
well , the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow .
wow sure thats great
oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity .
yeah yeah sure , just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .
terrific well uh , theres one more thing . uhh , uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic . yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish . so
sowhat ?
so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically , anatomically not jewish . do you know what im saying ?
yes
okay .
no . what ?
an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be
barmifsaed ?

so to get this part you cant be ?
nope .
but you are ?
yep .
but you told them you werent ?
thats right .
wow wow and its definitely all gone ? theres nothing there to work with ? what were you thinking ?
i dont know i really want this part and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes . like if-if they want you to ride a horse , you tell em you can and just figure out how to do it later .
joey this is not like learning to ride a horse this is like learning togrow a turtleneck
i kn-i know i know okay ? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .
oh my god , what are you gonna do ?
i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part .
unless
unless what ?
well , this may sound crazy , but there maybe something we could fashion .
like what ?
well im not sure yet , but umm of the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat .

hey ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower . okay , we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone .
okay . okay . all right , you take care of that . and meanwhile , the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list .
okay . okay well okay , who do we know thats coming ? me . are you ?

you let joey drive it ?
ive never driven it okay ? not once okay once . okay , i drive it all the time .
nice work everybody so much for the yknow , you can drive it , but dont tell rachel plan
wow i cant believe you lied to me .
okay , i can fix this okay monica , rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding .
great well rachel , the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver . there that wasnt about the wedding .
look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche ill be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block .
yeah , you got a couple hours ?

whew that was a brisk ride
take the top down did ya ?
only way to fly .

come on ross give me the keys monica does not know what shes talking about i am an excellent driver
youre fast and irresponsible . that adds up to a bad driver .
well in high school , that added up to head cheerleader .

did you see the look that girl just gave me ? huh ? she mustve seen me cruising in the bad boy .
i think shes checking out your beehive ross .
what ? give-give me a brush .
gimme the keys
no way
well no brush
fine yknow what ? it doesnt matter , because , if i remember correctly , there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom .

alimony .

chandler , we still havent gotten an rsvp from your dad .
oh right . umm , maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation .
chandler hes your father he should be at the wedding .
i dont even know the man . okay ? were not the close . i havent seen him in years .
well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked ?
well he doesnt have to know its not like we run in the same circles . i hang out with you guys , and he stars in a drag show in vegas .
ooh , i think i wanna trade circles .
trust me , you dont want him there either . okay ? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress .
so what as long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil i dont care .
okay , i think i need to do some shopping .

ahhh ooh , nice

my god

chandler , have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room ?

its not just their marriage i mean , look at yours . look at everybodys the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman and ive met me i am not paul newman . i dont race cars i dont make popcorn none of my proceeds go to charity .
but look chandler , right now , no one has a lower opinion of you than i do . but i totally believe you can do this .
i want to . i love her so much , but im afrits too huge .

maybe she hasnt really thought it through that well .
well , theres a lot to think about . i mean , how is she , how is she going to handle this financially ? how is she going to juggle work ? does she realize shes not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years ?

drake , ive discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss .
what is it ?
apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful . it seems your body is rejecting jessicas brain .
is it serious ?
not if we extract tissue from the original host body , synthesize antibodies , and introduce them into your system , which could stop it from rejecting the brain .
well that sounds simple enough , lets just do that .
we would , but when we went to exhume jessicas body , it was gone .

cut very nice people
okay , let me just get changed and we can go to dinner .
well dontwhat happened to jessicas body ?
im not telling , youll have to see it on tv

well , now she has no eyebrows , mission accomplished .
but monica , he loves his job so much can you just give him another chance ? please ?
all right , but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there

yeah and look , see how they expand as the baby grows ? and then after the babys born , theyre great for shoplifting melons .
oh good youre all here . thanksgiving tomorrow , four oclock . oh , guess who i invited . remember that guy will colbert from high school ?
no .
he was in rosss classmarching bandkinda overweight ? well , really overweight . i mean i was his thin friend .
wow i dont remember him . honey , are you sure youre not talking about your imaginary boyfriend .
no that was jarred wow i havent thought about him in a long time anyway , umm wills , wills here on business and he didnt have a place to go so i invited him here .
oh thats nice .
oh , and by the way , hes lost a bunch of weight . i mean he looks goo-ood okay , i mean really , really gorgeous i still love chandler .
i just want you to say it once in a while .
all right okay , just so you know , im not gonna make a turkey this year .
what ?
well phoebe doesnt eat turkey
phoebe
turkeys are beautiful , intelligent animals
no theyre not theyre ugly and stupid and delicious
all right okay , its just phoebe . wills still on a diet , chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food , and rachels having her aversion to poultry .
she is ?
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?
yeah . but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .
anyway , it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . okay ? its a lot of work .
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving i mean , thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie or friday with no two pizzas
all right fine if it means that much to you but justtheres gonna be a ton left over .
no there wont i promise i will finish that turkey
all right , youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?
thats right cause im a tribbiani and this is what we do i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders , we dont read a lot or run very fast , but damnit we can eat

hey , isnt weird to think about how next year at this time theyll be a little baby at the table ? rachels but good to know where youre at

no need to point , she knows who ross is .

so you were in an i hate rachel club ?
yes he was .
no . no .
so who else was in this club ?
uh actually , there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i dont think he-he knew what it was .
so ross , we went out for two years , and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club .
you went out with her ? we had a pact
that was in high school its not like it was binding forever .
then why did it have the word eternity in it ?
okay monica , did you know about this ?
i swear i didnt . hey is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ?
yeah .
hmm , a little relieved , i gotta say .
look rach i-im sorry , okay ? ii was a stupid kid , okay ? the only reason i joined
co-founded
co-founded . co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you . obviously i didnt handle it very well . but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club .
uh , except that it was really the i hate rachel club .
okay . so what ? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me ?
well , we did a little more than that .
no-no no-no . no-no .
what ? what else did you do ?
we started a rumor .
what rumor ?
oh , come on will just take off your shirt and tell us
ross
it was no big deal . we-wesaid that the rumor wasthat ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts .
what ?
thats right we said your parents flipped a coin , decided to raise you as a girl , but you still had a hint of a penis .
oh my god
you started that ?
what ? you heard that ?
everyone at our school heard it
everybody at my school heard it you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island ?
oh no oh my god this is all making so much sense to me now this is why adam carter wouldnt go out with me this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region
actually , billy tratt is gay now . so-so that ones not really our fault .
monica , how come you never told me this ?
i thought it might be true . and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me .

joey stop staring theres nothing there its not true
im afraid im gonna need proof .
oh

you are my everest .
joey , you dont have to finish that .
oh yes i do . otherwise whats next ? today im just a guy who cant finish a turkey , but tomorrow im the guy who eats half a powerbar , wraps up the rest , and puts in the fridge ? no no , i justi justi gotta change my pants . jeans have no give .
okay okay listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year , dear rach , youre such a good person . not girl person
rach , i think youre reading a little too much into it .
dear rach , youre a great person . sorry about your tiney-wienie .
look , what do you want me to do ? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasnt true ?
yes
could you also tell them im skinny now ?
oh me too
well look-look im not calling anybody okay ? it was like a million years ago
i dont care how long ago it was you told people that i was half and half yknow what ? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school .
thats not totally true .
what ?
what ?
well you-you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs. altman , our 50-year-old librarian .
how did you know that ?
its true ?
no .
yes it is i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog

mrs. altman ? she also made out with takaka ci-kek the night before he went back to thailand .
im sorry . when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman ?
hey she didnt look 50
did she look 16 ?
ohh , theres a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
oh wow
she didnt photograph well
well , she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings
so how did this happen ? did she , did she lure you to an early bird dinner ?
i was working late in the library one afternoon . it was just the two of us . she needed some help with her word jumble . and one thing led to another . if you must know , anita was very gentle and tender . may she rest in peace
didnt she walk with a cane ?
only when it was damp i cant believe you-you told people about this ? everybody knew ? yknow what ? im back in the club
yeah
i wanna join
whphoebe
im sorry . im sorry . i never got to be in a club . i-i didnt go to high school , but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french . bonjour .
all right , yknowfine you guys have your stupid little club , but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you you gave me a tiney-wienie
all right , listen youre just being silly . rachel , even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you . one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll
wow
and ross , if it werent for rachels rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were . she put you on the map
as a romancer of the elderly .
hey mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty .
the eyesdid still sparkle .
hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past . you-youve been through so much since then . and right now youve got so much more important stuff going on in your life . cant you just let this go ?

uh huh if its a girl , phoebe , and if its a boy , phoebo
maybe . but it wouldnt hurt to have a backup , you know ? uh , rach-rach , what were you thinking ?

huh . thats a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent .
okay fine , what do you have ?
well , ok , its for a boy . well , i know its a little out there , butdarwin .
wow , oh my god , our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard .
yeah , by sandrine .
youre just saying that cause i said no to your name

how-how about you each get five vetoes ?
all right .
all right .
that sounds fair .
yeah i dont think youre going to need it though . okay , check this out . if its a girl , rain .
veto .
why ?
rain ? hi . hi , my name is rain . i have my own kiln , and my dress is made out of wheat .
i know her i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show
okay , how about , for a guy , thatcher ?
ross , why do you hate our child ?

is it me , or is veto starting to sound really good ?

hey .
boy , do i have a surprise for you
sex on the balcony ?
no , but someones really not going to get over that idea , are they ?
what is it ?
i drew you a bath
honey , i dont like baths could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony ?
please , could you just try it for me ? come on , i used all my best stuff i-i-i lit some candles . i put on some music . i used bath salts , plus bubble bath and got you this little plastic navy ship . so its a boy bath
well , this does butch it up a bit .
i swear , if you try it , you will love it
all right , if i do this , can we at least discuss sex on the balcony ?
absolutely .

bet i know how that discussions going to go .

all right , this isnt so bad . i like the flower smell which is okay , because ive got my boat .
so ?
oh my god .
i told you you were a bath person hey , when you get out , maybe i can give you a facial
im going to need a bigger boat .

i dont think you had an open mind about the name ruth . i mean , come on , little ruthie geller , how-how cute is that ?
oh , oh my god i can practically hear the mahjong tiles
okay all your tests look fine . now , are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby ?
uh , no . no , were not .
but you have it right there in that file ? you could tell us whether its a boy or a girl ? dayton or sandrine ? phoebe or phoebo ?
thats right . but if you dont want to know
no , no , we want to wait , right ?
right . right .
oh , ill be right back . and , uh , i know its really not my place , but please dont name your child phoebo .
so , which of these babies do you think is the ugliest ?
what ? rach come on , thats terrible theyreuhtheyre babies . theyre-theyre all beautiful .

i saw you
okay fine , i did . but i didnt see anything , i swear .
shame on you ugly baby judges you
okay , but ross just listen to me
no , no , no , no dont tell me i dont want to know
but i couldnt even if i wanted to , because i dont know i swear i didnt see anything , and i dont want to know it was just a momentary lapse .
momentary lapse . dont-dont you have any self-control ?
okay , a couple months late on the lecture , ross .

hello ?
im in the bathroom , can you come in here ? i think theres something wrong .
you know what ? i-i think ill wait out here .
im in the bathtub .
oh . whats wrong ?
i drew my own bath , but i did it wrong the waters tepid . the salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places . and the scents i used dont compliment each other . eucalyptus and chamomileoh
what ?
the bath salts theyre starting to effervesce its different . its interesting .
okay , lets talk about something else .
yeah sure , sure . so , what was going on with you today ? oh-oh-oh
well , i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey . he was talking about rules and right and wrong and
i had the exact same conversation .
you did ? what was he talking about ?
i dont know joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth
that was a long night .
all right , lets break this down . what exactly did he say to you ?
okay , he was talking about rules .
uh-huh .
umm , and looking at people differently .
he didnt say anything about that to me .
what did he tell you ?
he was asking all these questions about you , me , and london . and , of course the glue that holds this all together , the rules .
okay . so you , me and london . looking at people differently . maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .
but what did he mean by rules ?
wait a minute he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in
because he was looking at her differently .
and phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules
my god he wants to do it with phoebe in london
you guys ?
just a minute thats mrs. tribbiani
you dont say anything .
why would i say anything ? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives and they would have me to thank , and we could all start having babies ?
im not going to let you say anything .
you just stay here
oh , god

oh , hey , monica , i brought back your iron .
oh , you had that ?
uh-huh .
i thought i lost it . i got a new one , like , a month ago .
oh , just as well , i broke this one .

what ?
nothing .
okay .
i mean , i-i , i really shouldnt say . i mean , im really not supposed to .
fine .
its a humdinger
then its really too bad that you cant tell me .
somebody likes you
is it chandler ?
no
well , then tell him to stop staring
its joey
really ? joey ? you dont say .
is it something youd be interested in ?
i dont know , i dont know , i dont know . you know , i mean , on the one hand , mother may i ? but yknow on the other hand no . no , i cant . were friends . no , oh , no . i dont want to risk what we have .
i guess that makes sense . so , you think youre going to talk to him ?
sure , yeah . i mean , its joey . i dont want him to get hurt . well , i must say , i am on fire first chandler , now joey
not chandler , just joey .
sure .

hey .
hey .
you know what ? ive been thinking about it . im really coming around on the name ruth . i think i would actually consider naming our child that .
rach , i-i cant tell you how-how much that means to me ohh wait a minute . wait a minute . you-you hated the name ruth why-why would you change your mind ? unless , you know were never going to have to use it . you did see the folder . you know its a boy
i didnt see anything i actually changed my mind about the name .
i dont think so youre just giving me ruth so youll get to name it when its a boy , and thats when youll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .
i wouldsequoia ?
veto .
fine .
unless you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named ruth well , im not falling for that okay ? ruth is off the table
but ross , you want the name ruth
not like this

hey .
hey . well , whats up ?
umm , joey , i know .
what ?
i knooow .
whaaat ?
i know about your feelings .
oh my god . you do ?
yes , and im sorry . i-i know things worked out for chandler and monica , but thats very rare .
i know . i know . and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys . i mean , its rachel for god sakes .
for god sakes , its rachel
i know . i know . and shes not only my friend shes my pregnant friend shes my pregnant friend whos ross ex
yeah thats rachel . beat me over the head with it .
what am i going to do ? you know , and i keep , i keep trying to get rid of these feelings , yknow ? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i dont like about her . you want to hear it ?
yeah .
she made me switch to light mayo . thats it thats all i got and , you know what ? it tastes the same and my pants fit better
joey , i just think youre getting worked up over nothing . this is probably just a crush .
you think ?

so , how did you propose ?
oh yeah . thats a great story .
well , um , actually , i-i took her to the planetarium . thats-thats where we had our first date . um , she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies , her favorite flower
oh that is so sweet
shhh i want to hear the rest
then , fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system , and the lights came down . and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words will you marry me ?

and the ring , was the size of my fist

i know im having the worst time . there was a 15-minute line for the buffet , and when i finally got up to the plates , i slipped on a giant booger
are you sure it wasnt an oyster ?
i guess it couldve been , i didnt really look at it . yknow , i just wiped it on chandlers coat and got the hell out of there .
hes just such a great guy im so excited about him .
oh hey , you should be excited about him . theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy .

whats that now ?
nothing
oh look its parker

thank you monica that was uh , interesting . wasnt it interesting , jack ?
why dont i remember this dog ?
ross , why dont you give us your toast now ?

you dont have to put a good spin on everything .
im sorry thats who i am . im a positive person .
no i am a positive person . you are like santa clause on prozac , at disneyland , getting laid

fine well then to quote ross , id better be going .
so long dont let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out

isnt this the most incredible fight youve ever had in your entire life ?
uh huh .

and then , we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar
ross , it just wouldnt have been feasible .
but having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem ?
it was really fun being married to you tonight .
yeah and and , it was the easiest 400 bucks ive ever made .
okay ross , can i uh , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
that proposal , at the planetarium
i know , i know it was stupid .
are you kidding ? with the , with the lilies , and-and the song , and the stars it wasreally wonderful did you just make that up ?
no , actually i thought about it when , when we were going out . its how i imagined i uh , i would ask you to marry me .
well , that wouldve been very hard to say no too .
its a good thing i didnt do it , because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding . okay , good night
goodnight

even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up ?
i will think about it .
thats all im askin

why did you invite my mother ?
what ?
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby .

eight weeks . i mean i love my mother , but my god , a long lunch with her is taxing .
i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me .
she cant hear you .
what ? you guys , come on what am i going to do ?
well , if you dont want your mother to move in with you , just tell her .
youre right . youre right . i mean im about to have a baby , i can tell my mother that i dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch oh my god shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me . this cannot happen
thats right . that is right , you go over there and tell her you dont want her to live with you . do not take no for an answer
okay .
this is great now shes gonna be mad at rachel yknow what ? and im just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had .
i have new respect for chandler . all right everybody its time to open the presents
yes yes and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby , because youre the most important person in this room . and in the world
well uh , i dont have a gift because i wasnt invited until the last minute , but thank you so much for bringing that to everyones attention .
how about you less important people , lets open your presents

mom thats okay that you didnt get you a gift

rachel , listen to your mother . she is very smart .

ross .
yeah ?
can i ask you something ?
uh-huh .
when carol was pregnant with ben
mmm ?
were you this irritating ?
wow
excuse me ?
oh nothing . nothing just uh , youve been a little short with me lately . im not trying to irritate you .
well then you just must have a natural talent for it .
yknow what ? the doctor will be in soon , why dont we not speak until then .
okay . seriously , breathe louder ross thats great
yknow we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby thats half human and half pure evil

hi dr. long , how are you ?
oh , youre nice to her .
she has the drugs
well do a quick check .
okay .
so , eight days late huh ?
yeah .
you must be a little uncomfortable .
eh , just a tad .
youre about 80 percent effaced , so youre on your way . it still could last a little while longer . if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along .
do them
actually , theyre things you can do . just some home remedies , but in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective .
well , we are ready to try anything .
okay , theres an herbal tea you can drink .
okay .
you can take some caster oil , theres eating spicy foods
great we will do all of those .
taking a long walk , and then theres the one thats proved most effective sex .

youve got to be kidding me

good job joe well done top notch

oh-ho-ho , yeah
which part exactly ?
the whole thing can we go ?
oh no-no-no , give me some specifics .

no . but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor .
yeah , we tried them all . we went for a walk , uh we tried a special tea , caster oil , spicy food nothing has worked .
well , there is one thing that we havent tried , but someone thinks that , that will open up a can of worms .
well what is it ? what is it ? if its gonna help bring the baby here , like today . i mean , i think you should do it .
its sex .
do it
monica
im just saying its been a really long time for you . i mean , women have needs . do it , get yours
oh i-i dont know about that . no , i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic .
all right , lets be practical , if ross isnt willing to do it , hes not the only guy in the world you can have sex with . you can borrow chandlerchandler is good
monica , what is the matter with you ?
nothing . i just want the baby to be born today .
why ? why today ?
okay fine i keep betting phoebe that youre gonna have the baby and i dont want to lose again

ill take that bet .
what ?
well , im miserable here i might as well make some money out it

dude i just did something terrible .
that was you ? i thought it was jack

what ? why does she think that ?
because it kinda looked like i did .
again , what ?
okay well , i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
as we all are at some point during the day .
it wasnt my ring it fell out of rosss jacket and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing
ross had a ring ? and he was gonna propose ?
i guess .
and you did it first ? this is gonna kill him you know how much he loves to propose
i know i know its awful .
well , what did she say ?
she said yes .
does ross know ?
oh god , what the hell am i going to tell him ?
well maybe you dont have to tell him anything .
oh , i like that . yeah
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out , but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass
now lets not get carried away .
i want a baby .
honey , weve been over this . i need to be facing the other way .
come on come on , if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant . do you think that closets still available ?

oh hey wait up
hi
congratulations i didnt want to say anything in front of joey cause i didnt know if he knew yet .
what , that we had a baby ? come on lets give him a little credit , although , he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier .
no no , that you and rachel are engaged
what ?
oh , its a secret . oh goodie yes we havent done the secret thing in a long time .
phoebe , there is no secret . okay ? i didnt propose .
are you lying ? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor ?
i am a doctor yknow what ? im just gonna go and talk to rachel myself .
all right , me too . should we wake her up ?
no no , come on let her sleep shes so exhausted .
and so engaged .
what ? oh my god she-she thinks were engaged why ? why ? why would she think were engaged ?
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ? yknow ross doctors are supposed to be smart .
i didnt give her that ring
really ?
no
so whose ring is it ?
its mine .
is it an engagement ring ?
yes
but you didnt give it to her ?
no
but you were going to propose ?
no
huh , i might be losing interest in this .
look . look , my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel , but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again .
oh , what beautiful lukewarm sentiment .
look , i didnt want to rush into anything . and it seemed like she didnt want to either . but i dont , i dont understand how any of this happened what ? did she find the ring in my jacket , assume that i was going to propose , throw it on , and-and just start telling people
no no , she said you actually proposed to her .
well i didnt i didnt propose unless uh did i ? i havent slept in forty hours andit does sound like something i would do .

look , we cant stay in here forever .
oh , i still cant believe my dad saw us having sex he didnt make it to one of piano recitals , but this he sees
this is okay . were all adults here theres nothing to be ashamed of . now , lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .
hi dad i can still call you that right ?
of course . ill always be your dad .
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there , that wasnt for fun .
it wasnt fun ?
why ? why-why-would youwh-why look , i just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want .

thats funny , this conversations how i got the bullet hole in my head .
this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother , she was
daddy i dont think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex .
youre right , youre right . this is about your positions . now , what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child , although it might feel good .
i dont feel good right now .
but pleasure is important , and it helps if the woman has an orgasm . you up to the task sailor ?

i know , yeah . i feel like we 're all growing up . person named wiener , god that kills me .
look at you all grown up .
actually , you know what ? i am . that whole thing with rachel made me realize that maybe i 'm ready for a more serious relationship . you know ? like i 'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady . and looks aren 't as important as nah , she 's gotta be hot .

okay , i have news . you don 't have to move to tulsa . you can stay here and keep your job .
it 's great how ?
chandler . well my boss and i worked out a deal where i only have to be in tulsa four days a week , so the other three i can be here with you .
so you 're gonna be gone four days a week ? no .
i 'm sorry , are you just used to saying that ?
no . i can 't be away from you for that long .
really ?
yeah , you 're my husband . i 'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year .

honey , thanks for trying to figure out a way , but if you 're going to tulsa , i wanna go with you .
hey , you said that without gagging
i know

excuse me ? oh yeah ? well , up yours too
who the hell was that ?
dr. wiener .
rach , you can 't call people at three in the morning .
oh you know what , you sound just like his wife
was there anything you did wrong with emma ?
yes , of course there is okay ? i 'm not insane
well , what was it ?
hiccups .
rach , i told you , you can 't call him every time any little thing comes up .
yeah well , not anymore i can 't . he fired us what are we gonna do ? we have to find a pediatrician . wait wait , monica said that when you guys were growing up , you really liked your doctor . what was his name ?
dr. gettleman ? yeah i know , i don 't think that 's a good idea . in fact , i think he 's dead .
argh why does everything happen to me ?
rach , i promise first thing tomorrow we 'll find another doctor , but i gotta get up early and i 'm not feeling all that well .
what ? what , do you mean you 're not feeling well ? what do you have ? is it rubella ? because don 't go near emma , she has not had that shot .
you know ? come to think of it , it does feel rubella-like
wiener , wiener wiener , wiener
rachel
great now he 's gonna know it was me

hey
hey
so how is this for our big double date tonight ?
oh my god
ooh , great just the reaction i was hoping for .
yeah , so you found someone for me . you didn 't forget ?
of course not and you 're gonna love mary ellen . she 's really smart and cute and funny , and i can 't tell you how i know this , but she not opposed to threesomes . so tell me some about my guy .
no .
come on , give me something . what 's his name ?
mike .
mike ? okay what 's his last name ?
damnit is there no mystery left in romance anymore ?
all right , we 'll se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours .

why did i have to say mike ? i don 't know a mike why couldn 't i have said there 's no guy in there

it 's impossible to find a good doctor . i mean , how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee ?
excuse me ?
i know what she 's talking about .
we 've got to find a new pediatrician . ross was getting sick last night , and i think emma may have caught it .
why don 't you go see dr. gettleman ?
ross said he died .
he didn 't die . i saw his daughter last week . said he was fine . her on the other hand , botched botox .
oh , great well , then i 'm gonna take emma to see him . i wonder why ross said that he died .
oh , maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist .
he saw a therapist ?
yeah , he used to have this recurring nightmare , just really freaked him out .
why ? what was it ?
that i was going to eat him .

mike
yeah ?
okay

i gotta tell you , i can 't believe i 'm doing this with you . although i did just get out of a nine-year relationship , so i guess i should be open and taking some risks .
everything is gonna be fine . just follow my lead , okay ? all you have to do is pretend to be mike .
i am mike .
atta boy

okay , look

joey , this is mary ellen jenkins . so , mike , how do you and joey know each other anyway ?
how do i and joey know each other ? wow , if i had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that .
from school .
yeah , we met in college . i mean , high school .
wow , you guys go way back then . so what are you up to these days ?
well , i 'm a lawyer .
mike , attorney at law
actually , i just gave up my practice .
what ? that 's the kinda thing you usually run by me .
i always wanted to play piano professionally , and i figured if i don 't do this now , i never will .
wow , that 's great i liked that better than the law thing , so
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .
i thought you thought he was still a lawyer .
no , no , that 's not what i meant . let 's get you a cocktail .

hey
hey
what are you doing ?
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa .
that 's so sweet . find anything ?
slim pickings .
nothing , huh ?
no , slim pickings , it 's a barbecue restaurant . they 're looking for a cook . actually cook may be a bit of a stretch . they 're looking for someone to shovel mesquite .
'slim pickings that is so cheesy .
'so cheesy also has an opening .
honey , that 's okay . i actually know this woman , nancy , who 's a restaurant biz head-hunter . maybe she 'll know of something .
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me . when we get to tulsa i 'm taking you for a great dinner at slim pickings . so cheesy ? whole hog ? it 's going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa .
hi , nancy . hi , it 's monica geller . i 'm good . listen , i 'm looking for a job in tulsa . well yeah , my husband has been relocated because i love him no , i don 't want a job in new york . javo is looking ? oh my god he asked for

hi , my name is rachel green , i have an appointment for emma .
dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient , he should be out shortly .
i think you just have a cold , it 's definitely not strep .
thanks doctor .
would you like a lollypop ?
you even have to ask ? he is alive

you know , it 's so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and i 've never heard about you .
yeah , that 's because we had a bit of a falling out . mike hit my mom with a car .
no , i didn 't .
that 's okay mike , i have forgiven you . and now we 're friends again everything 's great
mary ellen wait , is your mom okay ?
please , we 're trying to have a conversation .
wow , you 're a lot nicer on days of our lives .
'days of our lives that 's why you look so familiar
what ?
what ?
what ?
do you not know each other ?
of course we do mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school . yeah , where we pretend we don 't know each other . we played all kinds of games . hey , remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?
mike , let me ask you something . how many sisters does joey have ?
six
what are you doing ? i said seven argh
joey , why did you set me up with a stranger ?
because i forgot about our date , i 'm so sorry .
i 'm sorry too . and just to be clear , i didn 't hit his mother with a car .
you are unbelievable i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you , you know . mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose .
hey
who are you kidding ? you just find some guy off the street for me ? oh god this is humiliating
look phoebe i 'm so sorry hey , look , if you don 't like this guy i can find you a better one . mike mike
i 'm out of here
it was nice meeting you
you 're leaving too ?
i 'll stay if you can tell me my name .
good night

honey , we 're leaving tomorrow you 've still got a lot of packing to do .
you 're right . maybe i shouldn 't go .
what ?
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant , javo . it 's just a little outside of tulsa .
how far outside ?
manhattan .
and you 're thinking of taking it ? so before you said being me with me was more important than any job , but i guess now it 's old job , me , new job .
i 'm gonna miss this hand okay i know it 's a lot to ask , but oh my god chandler , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity .
what happened to you can 't live without me four days a week ?
well , if you really think about it , i mean four days is not that long . i mean , i see you monday before you go to work , and i see you thursday when you get back , and i always work late on tuesdays , so really if you think about it , it 's really
i think you should take the job .
really ?
yeah . i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .
that 's the nicest anyone has ever said to me

hey
how was the pediatrician ?
oh , i really liked him . yeah , it was really , really , really good .
you promised you wouldn 't say anything .
i know . ross still sees his pediatrician i don 't care
are you serious ? you still see dr. gettleman ?
he 's a brilliant diagnostician
diagnostician or boo-boo fixer ?
ross , seriously you 've gotta go to an appropriate doctor .
why ? why ? i know it 's a little weird , but hey , he 's a great doctor , okay ? he knows my medical history , and every time i go in there , he makes a big deal . ah look , it 's my favorite patient
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?
hey , i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college
that was not a security blanket that was a wall-hanging
it didn 't spend much time on the wall

excuse me , hi . i was hoping i would run into you . can we talk ?
sure .
i 'm sorry , really , i 'm so embarrassed . really , i 'm a pretty nice guy . just ask my parole officer apparently i 'm not a funny guy .
why did you go along with that ?
because i was told i 'd get a free dinner , which i didn 't . and that i 'd meet a pretty girl . which i did .
that 's true . well , is anything you told me about yourself true ?
my name in mike , and i do play piano .
prove it .
there isn 't a piano here .
that wouldn 't stand in the way of a true pianist .

you are really good i play a little guitar myself .
really ?
uhuh .
that 's great . what kind of music do you play ?
well , like acoustic folksy stuff . you know ? but right now i 'm working on a couple iron maiden covers .
do you think that maybe , sometime , i could
it 's okay . go ahead , ask me out .
okay . do you think maybe sometime i could take you out ?

oh , you just caught me off guard yeah , that would be nice .
look at this . my two best friends

wow , so your child is a big fan of the waldo books too ?
yeah , that 's how i know . i 'm ross by the way .
hi , i 'm sally . so , no ring . can i assume you are also a single parent ?
i am a single parent .
it 's hard isn 't it ? there 's almost no time for a social life . i mean , where are you gonna meet someone ?

-cut to rachel
hello
hey rach its me ok i just got the chandler 's room and i caught him molesting himself .
oh that couldn 't have been pretty. but you know guys do that .
yea well the weird part is he was getting off to a shark attack show
nooooooooo
yes chandler watches shark porn

well watching sharks ? are you sure that 's what he was doing ?
do you know how many times i 've seen him jump up like that , believe me i know what he was doing .
man sharks . i always knew there was something weird about that dude . but you promised to love him no matter what .
what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws
ah you know what honey guys are just different , they like things that we can 't understand , you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice .
eww are you talking about my bother .
yeah i didn 't disguise that very well did i .
hey
hi
listen to this i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her .

so basically you 've slept with all the woman in new york and now you 're just going around again .
well that 's not even the weird part . i don 't think she remembered sleeping with me .
but you don 't remember sleeping with her .
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable , you guys know .
what , how do we know , we never slept with you .
and who 's fault is that .
what 's the big deal , you forgot , she forgot , maybe you were having an off night
hey i never have an off night ok although sometimes when i 'm a little bloated i don 't feel very sexy but even then i 'm better then most
honey why don 't you just let it go and ask her out again .
yeah your both so slutty you don 't even remember who you 've slept with , you 're made for each other .
interesting. all right i 'll go out with her again and try to get past it oh salt bloaty
joey , joey .
what ?
you don 't think sharks are sexy do you ?
no . wait a minute what was the little mermaid ?

it 's open .
hey
hey mike called were going out again yay yay
yay quick thing , i went to talk to mike .
what ? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross
oh boy you got mad at that part . i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah , blah , blah , and i ended up telling him that .
what
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum .
what why ?
well he seemed to bum hard that you 'd never been in a serious relationship .
if you hadn 't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now
well phoebe , i think you 'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum , his a kite designer and he used to date oprah .
i 'm not going along with some lie you made ross , no i 'm just gonna be honest with him .
good yeah just be honest with him .
yeah i 've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven 't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month . ok i haven 't had a real boyfriend you know if he can 't handle that he can leave. which he will and that 's ok. so i 'll just be alone forever you know alright
i 'll get it
ok
you know i 'm trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren 't there , phoebe are you ok ?
uh huh yeah there 's just something umm , there 's something you should know vicrum just called .

so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents , a perfect couple getting divorced , i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest .
uh huh , sure , yeah . how can you not remember me ?
what ?
how could you not remember that we slept together ?
what when ?
i dunno
i really , really think i would remember sleeping with you
come on , come on , search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago , i was here you were here , we had sex here , here , here not there . anything ?
no it 's not ringing any bells .
my god woman how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this ?
hey hayley you 've really gotta fix that doorknob . joey
ooooooooooh , i slept with you and you obviously remember me hey i still got it . so were good . i 'll let myself out .

.and i said vicrum you can 't just call every time you get lonely you know , you , you gave up that right when you slept with rachel .
but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross
yeah well yeah you know emma 's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee .
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer .
i know but he call 's and my heart goes to him . you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer .
i just think there 's somebody better out there for you , i mean i 'm not saying me but. maybe me .
oh .
and you don 't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although i do smell the occasional magic marker , yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy .
ok i can 't do this .
what 's wrong ?
well there is no vicrum , ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship , i 've never lived with a guy , and i 've never even celebrated an anniversary so . if that 's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand . in fact i 'll close my
uh huh
so you don 't think i 'm a total freak
no. well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you .
i guess so , can i. can i think it 's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm , be a little concerned about the magic markers .
definitely
this is vicrum .

hi honey i 'm home
hi , how was your flight ?
oh it was great .
here why don 't you sit down , get yourself comfortable because i. have a little surprise for you .
well , well , well it must be five in tulsa because it 's six o clock in ny.c
ok this is how much i love you .
honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around .
is this not the good part ? do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier .
no i 'm not quite sure you got the right movie that 's all .
oh well this is the only one they had at our video store , but they did have something called crocodile killers . or does it always have to be sharks ?
does what always have to be sharks .
honey look we can do something else , do you want me to get into the tub and thrash .
what 's going on ?
sweetie it 's ok , i still love you , let me be a part of this .
let me be a part of this
i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks turn you on
no they don 't
then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat .
oh my god when you came in i switched the channel , i was just watching regular porn
really ?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action .
i cannot tell you how happy that makes me
you are an amazing wife . no really you 're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me , i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that .
im very , very drunk right now .

see ordinarily i would talk to her , but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her ? did i not sleep with her ?
you know maybe this is a wake up call , about your whole dating attitude . your in your thirty 's and you 've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship , here you go from woman to woman , meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn 't
your right i love my life i actually did sleep with her .

awesome .
oh , and the people are so nice . there 's this one guy , geoffrey , he 's the maitre d. , chandler , you will love him . he is without a doubt , the funniest guy i have ever met .

this is nice .
i know
you need both hands for that ?
yeah , i kinda do . well , how 's this ?
aaahhh , look at you two holding hands huh is this getting serious ? have you not talked about it yet ? am i making you uncomfortable ? if you were bigger you 'd hit me , huh ? aaaaaahhhhhh
i 'm sorry i 'm sorry . it 's obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation .
is it ?
maybe not , is it ?
okay , when i got divorced , i didn 't think i 'd feel this way about someone for a really long time then again , i didn 't think i 'd meet someone like you and this may be crazy soon , but i want you to have this no , not that 's gum . ooh , five
i know mike , why don 't you keep digging ?
oh , sorry .
oh , it 's a key . to be honest , i think i 'd prefer the five dollars .
it 's to my apartment .
oh wow , ooh ooh , big step for phoebe and mike .
yeah , look , and i don 't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because
oh no , i want to .
oh , thank god .
yeah ooh wow even started to think i 'd never meet someone that , you know , i wanted to do this with . here you go .
is this cool , huh ?
it really is .
oh , i know it it is amazing these little things open doors huh

so i don 't go back to work for another four weeks , but we would like our nanny to start right away , so that emma could get a chance to know her .
i think that 's really smart . the easier we can make the transition for her , the better .
that 's great , great . so do you have any questions for us ?
not really .
allright . well thank you so much for coming
thank you .
really nice to meet you and we 'll call you .
oh , you know , wait . i do have one question . do you guys do random drug testing ?
boy , we uhm hadn 't really thought of that .
that 's cool . but but if you do , i 'm gonna need three days notice .
okidoki wow we 're never gonna find a nanny .
oh , come on rach , we will . i promise . we have more interviews and worse comes to worse , we can always reconsider the uhm the first one we met with .
what , the blonde with no bra ?
she was blonde ? just a sec . okay , okay . this one 's name is sandy . she 's got a degree in early childhood education , uhm she worked for her last family for three years .
okay
hi i 'm sandy .
and she 's a little mannish

oh my god david
hi i-i-is this a bad time ?
no it 's a great time , come in wow , hi oh my gosh what are you doing here ? are you back from minsk ?
well , just for a couple of days , uhm i 'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant , why it 's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm accomplished uhm nothing .
who cares , it got you here .
well , it got me to new york anyway , and then i got on a cab at the airport , and the guy said where to ? and i just gave him your address i i i didn 't even think about it .
wow . where is your luggage ?
damn it
a-allright , well i 'll call the cab company .
wa wa wait we can call them later . can you just just stand there f-f-for a moment ? boy there 's an old russian expression , uhm it goes schto ya ztez vigul ui roughly translated that means uhm this thing that i 'm looking at wow
thank you god , no you should see me when oh actually , no , i look pretty good .
are are you kidding ? you know , when you don 't see someone for a long time , a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about come on , don 't be crazy . nobody is that beautiful , but well , you are . well , so , uhm are you
no

i 'm i 'm just i 'm the worst person ever . how can i not tell david that i 'm seeing mike ?
maybe he didn 't give you a chance .
he said are you seeing someone ? and i said no
oh , well that had been your window .
yeah i mean , i don 't know . i was just , i was looking , i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking oh my god it 's david . david 's here . he 's just , he 's so irresistible .
really ? the scientist guy ?
really ? chandler ?
continue
oh.okay , then it gets worse , cause then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night .
phoebe
i know evil and and and i like mike so much , you know . it 's just going really well . oh my god
wow , isn 't it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ?
uhuh yeah , you know . and given my life long search for irony , you can imagine how happy i am .
what are you gonna do ?
i mean i guess , i just have to tell david that nothing can happen between us . unless i don 't you know , complicated moral situation , no right , no wrong
you have to tell david
okay , i knew i should have had this conversation with joey .

funniest guy she 's ever met i 'm funny , right ? what do you know , you 're a door you just like knock-knock jokes save it for inside
heeeeeey
hey
hey
so oklahoma is a crazy place . you know , they call it the sooner state . frankly i 'd sooner be in any other state . and what 's with oklahoma having a pan handle ? can all states have stuff like that ? hey yeah , i 'm from the waistband , wyoming . but when i was
was your cabin pressurised ?
and don 't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk .
okay .
what 's with the word y 'all ? you know , just two words just pushed together are we all allowed to do that , because if so , i say why stop there ? you know , your new poodle could be your noodle . and fried chicken ? could be fricken.waiter , waiter excuse me , i 'll
no , it just remind me of something this guy did today at work . i told you about that funny guy , geoffrey , right ?
yeah , he came up
well , he did this bit you probably had to be there , but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer , eating a raw chicken .
were you there ?
no , but it sounds like it was fricken funny

i really do understand how hard it 's gotta be to leave your child with another person . i mean , it 's leaving behind a piece of your heart
sandy , that 's exactly what it is
are you gay ?
ross
it 's okay . i get that a lot doing what i do . but i am straight . i-i 'm engaged actually .
oh
her name is deliah .
oh , that 's pretty .
so you 're just like a guy who 's a nanny ?
i realise how it 's a bit unorthodox for some people , but i really believe , the most satisfying thing you can do with your life , is take care of a child .
okay .
like in my last job , i met daniel when he was three weeks old . and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person when i left , i said i 'll see you soon and he said to me skdandy that was his name for me i 'll see you every day right in
yeah , kids say all kinds of crap .
oh god , she mu she must need her diaper changed .
oh , oh , i can do it for her , if you want
oh , that would be great i love him , i love him , i love him
oh , come on , rach , he 's a guy
so wh ? he 's smart , he 's qualified . give me one good reason we shouldn 't try him out .
because , it 's weird
why ?
what kind of job is that for a man ? a nanny ? i-it 's like if a woman wanted to be
yes ?
king ?
i er i hope you don 't mind . i used some of my home-made lotion on emma . it 's a mixture of calendula and honey cream . it 'll dry that rash right up . plus it keeps the hands young
please ? yes sandy you 're hired .
that 's great i 'm sorry . it 's just such an emotional thing when you 're welcomed into a new family
oooh i really can 't hear what she says come here .
you gotta be at least bi

hey i need you to set me up for a joke . later , when monica is around , i need you to ask me about fire trucks .
ooh . i-i don 't know chan . i 'm not so good with remembering lines .
well , thank god your livelihood doesn 't depend on it .
i know , right ? wh wh why are we doing this ?
monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she 's ever met .
seriously ? she actually said that ?
yes am i crazy to be this upset ?
nooooo being funny is your thing
yeah
without that , you just got lame with women .
ye

well but david , just i just want you to know that that you know telling you this is one of the hardest things i 've ever had to do .
well just so you know hearing it wasn 't exactly a vladnik carnival either can we at least hug goodbye ?
of course , yeah . you know , a kiss on the cheek wouldn 't be totally inappropriate
no no
i mean
in minsk
yeah ?
it 's uhm i-it 's two on each cheek and uhm and one on the lips .
well , if that 's what they do in minsk in new york it 's

no , i think we should save our china for something really special . like if the queen of england comes over .
honey , she keeps canceling on us , take the hint .
what if something gets broken , they 're so expensive .
what is the point of having them if we never use them ?
ok , but if something gets broken , and then the queen comes over
i will explain it to her .
< laughs > oh yeah , like i 'm going to let you talk to the queen .

i do not .
oh really . okay. let me ask you something . yesterday at the coffee house , i went to the bathroom and when i came back , my muffin was gone-who took it ?
somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in , went straight for your muffin and i said hey don 't eat that-that 's phoebe 's and he said < pause > he said joey you stink at lying . what am i going to do ?
don 't worry , don 't worry . we 'll come up with a good lie . i 'll help you practice it .

amy < pause > yes i do i really do . < grabs ross hand for support >

hello ? yeah , um . hang on one sec . < to ross and rachel > can i take this upstairs ?

seriously ? its its just these rooms ? < moves hands around motioning just these rooms > < to ross > i thought you were a doctor .
yeah , no . ross has a phd .
ew . < walks into rachel 's room , i 'm guessing >
god she is unbelievable .
i know , i mean a phd is just as good as an md .
oh sure ross , yeah . if i have a heart attack in a restaurant , i want you there with your fossil brush .
stupid thanksgiving .
what ? what happened ?
my boyfriend canceled on me . i mean i i finally find a real relationship . i mean , someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town . i swear , its almost not worth dating married guys .
don 't say that .
oh . i was so looking forward to this . it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving . we were going to have sushi .
oh amy , don 't cry amy . um ross , could i talk to you in private ?
sure , you want to go upstairs ?

um look i was thinking if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving .
you know , i think thats a great idea . it 'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis .
look i know she 's a little tough to take . she has no where else to go , and she 's my sister . alright , she 's emma 's aunt . and i would like them to bond .
ok , fine , but i don 't want them bonding to much . i don 't want her telling emma she needs a nose job .
ross , you know what ? she may need one we 're just going to have to make our peace with that

monica and chandler 's apartment
hi .
hi , hey .
hey you guys , this is my sister amy . this is chandler , joey , phoebe and you know mon .
hi .
oh my god . you 're on days of our lives .
yeah .
wow . they must put a lot of makeup on you .
hap hap happy thanksgiving .

hi .
hi .

hey you .
so . welcome . is this your first time you 're seeing emma ?
yeah i i think so . < sticks her hand out to shake hands with phoebe and says to her > it 's nice to meet you emma .
phoe-be .
oh . that 's a funny noise .

pheebs , i still need some help here
oh right , ok um . ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it . . for example if you look down at the ground when you 're talking , people know you 're lying .
oh i don 't know why this is so hard for me. you know i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor .
you are a terrific actor .

hey . hey where 's the baby ?
oh we just put her down for a nap .
oh i was just thinking . you know what would be incredible ? if you guys died .
thank you amy .
no , no , then i would get the baby . i mean you know it would be just like a movie . like at first i wouldn 't know what to do with her , then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i 'd get married .
thats a great movie . < she claps >

now listen , not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you 'd be dead . i was thinking about changing her name . i 'm just not really a big fan of emily .
emma .
emma , ross wants you .
phoe-be .
why does she keep making that noise ?
honey , i don 't know how to tell you this , but um , if something were to happen to ross or to myself < ross and rachel knock on wood > um you wouldn 't get the baby .
well who would ?
well we haven 't offically asked them yet , but we would want monica and chandler .
i can 't believe you 'd want us to raise emma .
yeah oh my god , i 'm so moved .
i don 't believe this , hold on a second . you guys die and i don 't get your baby ?
see look amy , we 're a lot closer to monica and chandler . we see them every day . and truthfully honey , you don 't seem very connected to the baby .
connected ? i mean to what ? she 's she 's a lump .
you know , guys i got to say . this means so much to me . that you would trust me with your child . i mean , we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own . you know i 've had my doubts about my skills as a father ,
< points to chandler > this guy ? seriously ?
later in the day .
okay it 's time for dinner . everyone we 're using our fancy china um and its very expensive so please be careful .
woah . woah < nearly really drops the plate and more seriously > woah .
okay , just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved . < pinches ross arm >
ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt .
hey how come my plate 's less fancy then everyone else 's ? do you not trust me with a fancy plate ?
no , honey , its. thats a special plate . see its a game , whoever gets that plate wins .
i can 't believe i won .
its such a slap in the face . i 'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me .
monica is ross sister .
no , ross sister was really fat .
that was me .
no , she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog .
hey . amy . you 've got to stop doing that .

okay , listen i know you 're having a little bit of a family crisis , but you don 't have to take it out on the plates . i mean , i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this .

now see , this way you protect the plate and lets face it you have fun .
okay , how about this , you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies , then do i get the baby ?
no , if crazy plate lad < sees monica frustrated at this comment > if monica dies then i would get emma , right ?

well actually
actually what ?
well its just. its just in that case , then um . emma would go to my parents .
what ?
hurts , doesn 't it ?

uh who has to die for me to get her ?

so if monica 's not around , then i 'm not good enough to raise emma ?
no , that that is not what we 're saying .
yeah he 's lying . he looked down .

well what is wrong with me ? am i am i incomptent ? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
honey , you 're taking this the wrong way . we think you 're going to be a wonderful parent . it 's just you 're more the fun parent .
yeah and we 'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin someone who can be firm and strict .
thats not how you see me , is it ?
no you 're all about the fun .
look , i may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think i 'm not capable ?
no , you both are equally capable . its just you 're strongest when when you 're together .
ok . so if we both had emma and i die < knocks on table > she 'd have to give her up .
sure , monica would have to give her up .
i lie better then that , right ?
so let me get this straight . so my two friends die , i get emma . then my wife dies , then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me ?
there 's your movie < claps >
later on .
monica opens her front door . chandler is sitting in the hallway .
hey . there you are . you disappeared after dinner .
oh ? did somebody miss me ? is there a child to raise poorly ?
ross and rachel don 't know what they 're talking about . i mean its not like their so responsible . emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom .
yeah but they 're right . i mean , i 'm not a strong father figure and i never will be .
no you learn these things . you grow into it .
yeah , but its not who i am . everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid . and its true . and look everybody knows it .
i don 't know it i want to have a kid with you because i think you 're going to be an amazing dad at the fun parts and the hard parts .
oh yeah , well can you picture me saying go to your room you 're grounded ?
can you hear me say you 're grounded ?
you said that to me last week .
how hard is it ? no shoes on the furniture .
back to monica and chandler 's apartment .
amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad .
the producer from days left a message on my machine asking why i wasn 't at the parade . they said everybody 's pissed off at me < whiny voice > and they all got to meet santa
it 's ok . i thought of the perfect lie for you . it 's easy to remember and doesn 't invite a lot of questions . you weren 't at the parade because you had a family emergency .
oh , i like that , yeah . wasn 't at the parade because i had a family emergency .
ooh , what happened ?
oh my sister 's raccoon .
no nothing with a raccoon .
arg alright , i 'll take care of it . < throws hands out in the air >
monica and chandler come through the front door .
oh wait what are you doing ?
setting the table .
yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too .
oh how nice . maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress .
ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy yeah thats the techinal term he goes to chandler .
hey dude , you okay ? sorry about before .
oh no thats okay , you 're totally right . i don 't know anything about disciplining a child . but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die , you don 't get joey .
ross walks away with a face of yeah ok .
ucch . < pauses > uchh < louder this time > in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not talking to you .
uchh < much louder and longer then amy 's >
you know this this is classic rachel .
yeah yeah right remember in high school when i died and didn 't give you my baby ?
this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel . i mean , you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer .
what ? what carrer ?
um i 'm a decorator .
ok . you decorate dad 's office and so now you 're a decorator . okay i went to the zoo yesterday and now i 'm a koala bear .
why can 't you ever be supportive ?
sup you want to talk supportive ? you didn 't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby .
oh . yeah . well you didn 't come see me when i was in the hospital when i was getting my lips done .
i did the first time oh . oh < gets up and walks into the kitchen > and you know what . you want to know why i 'm not giving emily to you .
emma .
oh whose side are you on ? < back to amy > i 'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child .
how hard could it be ? you do it .
ooh oooh
do you want to know why you don 't want me to have the baby ?
uh huh .
because you don 't want me to be happy . you you have always been jealous of me .
jealous of what ? of your lack of responsiblity ? you , your immaturity ? your total disregard of other people 's feelings ?
uh to name a few . you know you know you 've just always been like this . you just have to have everything . and i couldn 't have anything . like in junior high , when you stole timmy from me . i mean , do you even realize how much that hurt me ?
timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him
oh come on , that was 20 years ago . get over it .
i cannot , i cannot believe that i invited you here today .
yeah , well you know what i cannot believe . that my so-called sister , gets a 30 discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail .
ah ha ha. ah ha ha . < evil meancing laughter > it 's forty five .
you bitch . you just think you 're so perfect . with your new baby and your , your small apartment . < directs this to ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table > well let me tell you something . your baby isn 't even that cute .

too far , amy . too far .
you take that back .
no .
take it back
no what are you going to do ? make me ?
heey man , i work out .

so do i.
i do pilates .
i do yoga .

uh , yeah i think i did .
alright . thats it < pushes amy back >

frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy

oh my god shouldn 't we stop this ?
what ? are you out of your mind ? lets throw some jello on them .

ew gross .

alright that is it . this is our apartment and you can not behave this way . now if you can 't act your age then you shouldn 't be here at all . now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out , but they 're very important to monica . i
i 'm sorry .
mon , i 'm so sorry .
okay . thats better . now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it .
sorry .
by the way , that fight was totally arousing .
dude . well done . you know what ? if i die , and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma .
oh yeah ? well thanks .
so , so now do i get joey ?
okay , but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose .

are you okay mon ?
uh huh i mean these things happen . its just a plate . its not like somebody died .
it 's all right . you can mourn .
thank you . it was so beautiful . < gets up and walks towards the front door > i 'm going to go to joeys and get the pies .
actually its not pies , its just pie .
i don 't care . < pauses and realizes > oh my god . i 've lost the will to scold .
look amy , it got a little of control um and i 'm sorry . you 're my sister and uh if it really means that much to you
so you 're going to give me the baby ?
uh . no i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount .
you are not going to regret this .

she needs changing .
oh no no no i 'll get her . i 'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma . i 'll be right there emma . just let me get my trusty diaper bag here . < knocks over the box of china > well what do you know ? i guess , i 'll be

hey , does monica know about her broken plates yet ?
nope
broke them all , huh ?
yep
you gonna tell her ?
nope hey so i 'm gonna put the plates back . you know , i think you were right , i don 't think we should use these plates again for a looong time .
like only if the queen comes ?
maybe not even then .
hey i did it . i called my producer . i told him i had a family emergency , he totally bought it . thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs .

bye plates
oh , you told her you broke all the plates , huh ?

yep . that 's a lot of cats jo lynn . single are ya ?

chandler bing .
hey . how come you 're answering your own phone ? where 's your crazy assistant ?

braid each other 's hair and ride horseback on the beach ?
no , no , no . when you get home tomorrow night , you and i are going to be at the wizzards-knicks game . . . courtside
courtside ? oh my god .
yeah . maybe michael jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee .
that 's so cool . i 'll let monica know .

hello ?
joey just called . he 's got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night .
really ? but tomorrow night is the only night i get off from the restaurant . if you go to the game , we won 't have a night together for another week .
but hey , it 's courtside . the cheerleaders are going to be right in fr . . . that 's not the way to convince you .
chandler look , i don 't want to be one of those wives who says , you can 't go to the game . you have to spend time with me . so , if you could just realize it on your own . . .
i know . you 're right . i want to see you too . i 've just got to figure out a way to tell joey , you know ? he 's really looking forward to this .
tell him that you haven 't seen your wife in a long time . tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult . tell him that what little time we have is precious .
yeah , ah , ah . . . i 'll think of something .

wow wow , you look . . . uh . . . it 's just , ah . . . that dress . . . uh . . .
well , i hope the ends of these sentences are good .
well , well , they 're good . it 's been a while since i 've seen you like this . you , you clean up good .
oh well , well thank you . okay , stop . stop looking at me like that . the last time that happened , that happened .
oh right , right . so , are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your , your first night away from emma ?
yeah , yeah . phoebe and i are going to have so much fun . and thank you for watching the baby , by the way .
oh , it 's fine . actually , i , i invited mike over .
phoebe 's mike ?
yeah .
i didn 't know you guys hung out .
we don 't . but i thought it would be nice to get to know him . you know , maybe have a little dinner , drinks , conversation .
oh that 's so cute ross and mike 's first date . is that going to be awkward ? i mean , what are you guys going to talk about ?
i don 't know . but , you know , we , we have a lot in common , you know . he plays piano i played keyboards in college . he 's been divorced i have some experience in that area .

yeah .

hi
hey .
oooh . girl 's night out indeed .
ok . so now , i think emma is probably down for the night , but if you need anything ross . . .
rach , rach , we 'll be fine , all right ? you go have fun .
okay . you too . and i hope you score . bye .
bye .
so . . . welcome .
i got beer .
i got bottled breast milk .
eh , why don 't we start with the beer ?
okay . so , um , phoebe tells me you , ah , you play piano .
yeah .
you know , i , i used to , ah , play keyboards in college .
ah ? do you have one here ?
no .
okay .

um . . . ah . . . you know , i 'm divorced . um , phoebe , ah . . . phoebe said you . . . you 've been divorced ?
yeah . yeah , i 'm sorry . i don 't . . . i don 't really like to talk about it .
that 's okay . we 'll talk about something else .
so , you 're a paleontologist , right ?
yeah .
my cousin 's a paleontologist .
ah ? well , he and i would probably have a lot to talk about .

hi .
hey .
welcome home .
oh well , look at you .
yeah . what do you think ?
well , it looks great . it 's just that . . . well , i 'm wearing the same thing underneath . so . . .
oh .
see what i mean . . .

hey how come the door 's locked ?
just a second .
no , no , no , no , no . joey can 't know that i 'm here .
why not ?
because i didn 't know how to tell him that i couldn 't go to the knicks game . so , i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa .
so , you lied to him ?
achhh . it 's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion . except with you .
hey open the door . what 's going on ?

what are you . why are you dressed like that ?
oh , because , um . . . well , chandler 's going to be home in a couple of days . so , i thought i would , you know , practice the art of seduction .
oh , i thought i heard a man 's voice before .
oh i was just doing chandler 's side of the conversation . you know , like , hi , how do i look ? really sexy . could i be any more turned on ?
okay . whoa , whoa . why are there two glasses of wine out ?
because . . . one of them is for you .

cheers . okay , buh-bye .
you know , it 's funny . i 've been , ah , practicing the art of seduction myself . hi ya .
you might want to keep practicing .
yah .

it 's joey . hey joe .
dude , come home
what ? why ?
come . . . home .
look i , i can 't . what 's going on ?
i don 't know how to tell you this but , uh . . . i think monica 's cheatin on ya . i told you shouldn 't have married someone so much hotter than you .

all right look . if you can 't come home and deal with this , then i 'm gonna .
no
i just heard him

no . all right , i 'm going in .
no wait
i heard him again
all right , look . just stay there . i 'm coming home .
okay . great . i 'll see you when you get here . i 'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out .
is that really necessary ?
absolutely . you 'd do it for me . not that you ever have to because i know how to keep my women satisfied .

shouldn 't the pizza be here by now ? i mean , they said thirty minutes or less . well , how long has it been ?
eleven minutes . and now twelve . so , do you like the beer ?
i do . i do . although , it 's actually a lager .
huh . what 's the difference between beer and lager ?
i don 't know . we could look it up .
things are about to get wild .

oh god . remember the girls nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and ross ?
oh god . it seems like forever ago .
i know . so , what 's going on with you and ross ?
well , um . . . i don 't know . i mean , for a long time nothing . but you know , actually right before you picked me up , ross and i had a . . . ah . . . little thing .
oh my god i love things . what happened ?
well , um , first he told me he liked how i looked . and , ah , then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact .
eye-contact ?
mm-hmm .
i hope you were using protection .
excuse me . um , these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar .
oh . should we send them something back ?
oooh . let 's do . let 's send them mashed potatoes .
no wait no , no . don 't do that that 's going to make them think they can come over here .
so ? what if they do ?
well , we 're not here to meet guys . you have a boyfriend , i have a b . . . baby and a ross .
yeah , but , ah , ah , nothing has to happen . we 're just having fun . you know , not everything had to go as far as eye-contact .

chandler , you have to tell joey that you 're not in tulsa .
don 't you think it 's better for him to think that you 're cheating on me , than for him to think that i 'm cheating on him ? i heard it .
i don 't want him to think that i 'm having an affair .
all right . i 've got a plan . i 'll go down the fire escape .
yes , because all good plans start with , i 'll go down the fire escape .
hear me out woman . i 'll go down the fire escape . then , i 'll wait for a while . then , when i come up the stairs , it 'll be just like i just got back from tulsa . then , joey and i will come in and see that there 's no guy in here
aren 't you afraid that joey 's going to figure all of this out ? i heard it .

i 'm just going to wait for a little while .
scary pigeon 's back ?
it 's huge .

oh my god . i can 't believe you live in that building . my grandmother lives in that building . ida green ? no sense of personal space ? kind of smells like chicken ? looks like a potato .
spuds is your grandmother ?
that 's my bubby
so , we 're on our way to a couple of parties . um . . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun .
yeah . . . i 'm sorry . we weren 't really looking for anything to happen with you guys . i , i have a boyfriend .
all right . it 's no big deal . bill so , she has a boyfriend . what is your situation ? rachel oh , well , it 's complicated . i don 't actually have a boyfriend . but um . . . bill then , can i have your number ? rachel i 'm sorry , no .
i don 't know . he was cute , and he liked me . it was an impulse .
what about ross ? what about your moment ? don 't you want to talk to ross about it ?
no . no , because i know exactly how the conversation 's gonna go . hey ross , you know , i think we had a moment before .
yeah . me too .
well , but i 'm not sure i really want to do anything about it .
yeah . me neither .
well , should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we 're really feeling ?
yeah . that works for me .
yeah , i see what you mean . by the way , nice ross imitation .
oh , thanks .
but , your rachel wasn 't whiny enough .
wha . . . hey
better
well , the point is , maybe i should just stop waiting around for moments with ross , you know ? i should just . . . move on with my life .
really ? you 're moving on from ross ?
i don 't know . do i have to decide right now ?
well , you kind of just did . that guy is going to call you tonight . ross is going to pick up the phone and that 's a pretty clear message .
oh god , ross . ross is going to pick up the phone . oh , i have to get my number back . oh my god . he 's gone .
oh , i have to get my number back . oh my god . he 's gone . dead on .

ya know , i 'm going to take off .
so soon ?
well , yeah .
okay . well , thanks , ah , thanks for the beer .
ah , you mean lager .
ah yeah . good times .

oh .

hello ?
hey , mike , it 's me . listen , is um , is ross near you ?
uh , no . i just left .
well , you have to go back in .
wha . . . ? go back ? to the land where time stands still ?
i 'm so sorry honey , but , okay , rachel gave this guy her number and , um , she doesn 't want ross to answer the phone . so , you have to intercept all his calls .
i can 't do that
he says he can 't do that .
oh give me , , , hi , mike ? hi . listen . i know this is a lot to ask , but you know what ? if you do this i . . . phoebe will . . . do anything you want . seriously , i 'm talking dirty stuff .
all right . hello ? hi . i 'm sorry about her , but she wasn 't wrong about the dirty stuff .
all right . i 'll do it . but really , how much dirtier can it get ?
oh , mike . bye .

hey buddy .
uh , hi .
um , can i come back in ?
why ?
i , i was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about .
but you left .

wow that didn 't take long . i thought you said tulsa was , like a three hour flight .
well , you 're forgetting about the time difference .

chandler you 're home
that 's right . you 're husband 's home . so , now the sex can stop .

what are you saying ?
joey said that you 're in here with another man .
there 's no man in here . how dare you accuse me of that .
all right . all right . then , maybe you won 't mind if me and my friend take a look around , huh ? bwa-ah-ah

what is he doing ?
i arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy .
bedroom is clear , although you might need some new pillows .
all right . well , i 'll check the guest room .
why do i smell men 's cologne ?
i think that 's you .
oh yeah . i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier .
there 's nobody here joe .
i guess not .
i can 't believe you thought i was cheating . you own me an apology .
yeah , right monica . i 'm so sorry .
ah , it 's an honest mistake . it could happen to anyone . all right , see ya .
whoa , whoa . wait a minute . wait a minute . if you just got back from tulsa , how did your suitcase beat you here ?
i climb down the fire escape and you can 't put that in the closet ?

so , except for the fermentation process , beer and ale are basically the same thing . fascinating isn 't it .
maybe you should look up fascinating .

i 'll get it . hello ? ross 's place . mike speaking . it 's for you .
i don 't understand what just happened here .

what 's going on ?
i 'm sorry . i , i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica and i , i didn 't know . . . i didn 't think you 'd understand .
what ? you think i 'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife ? huh ? do you think i 'm like , duh .
joey ?
yeah ?
i don 't know what to say . we shouldn 't have lied to you .
yeah . i feel so bad . is there anything i can do to make it up to you ?
yeah , you could go to the game with me , ah , even though i know you said you couldn 't . but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head .
i 'm sorry . that 's the one thing i can 't do . i promised i 'd be with monica .
all right .
you can go .
what ?
you should go to the game . it 's okay . i want you to .
really ? you 're gonna be okay ?
yeah , i 'll be fine . you know , maybe i 'll stay here and practice the art of seduction .
you 're gonna put on sweats and clean , aren 't you ?
it 's gonna be so hot
okay , bye .
have fun .
thanks . here 's your ticket .
hey , listen . i 'm never going to lie to you again , okay ? and i want you to know that nobody thinks you 're stupid .

that 's the perfect amount
okay

this doesn 't feel weird
i know .
you 're a really good kisser .

well i think it 's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .
eh , we weren 't that close anyway
eh

so , are you really gonna go out with that nurse man ?
well uh , you and i are just goofing around , i thought , why not just goof around with him .
y 'know , i don 't know if you 've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary well , i have , and the technical definition is , two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together . but if you have this new fangled dictionary
i think you 're better than you think you are .
really ? okay , so
know when to stop .
y 'know , i sensed that i should stop . so we 're okay ?
yeah . don 't do the dance .

ehh .
eh , you work for that .
look , i thought about it too , and i 'm sorry . i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
you do ?
yeah , i 'm putting my foot down . yeah look , when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy , and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy , then , then that 's what we 're gonna do .
oh , you 're so sweet . oh , but wait , what about our , what about the future and stuff ?
eh , forget about the future and stuff so we only have two kids , y 'know ? we 'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .
you thought about that ?
yeah .
how many kids were we gonna have ?
uh , four , a boy , twin girls and another boy .
what else did you think about ?
well , stuff like where we 'd live , y 'know ? like a small place outside the city , where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff . y 'know , we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty
y 'know what ? i-i don 't want a big , fancy wedding .

i 've got nowhere to go this morning . i 'm unemployed i don 't know what i 'm gonna do with my life .
well , i just lost my erection .
i mean , what am i supposed to do with myself ?
you 're supposed to find your passion in life . you can be whatever you wanna be now . it 's exciting .
but it 's all so overwhelming . i don 't know where to start .
hey , wait a second . i can help you with this . you just need to be organized . we can make a list of your qualifications , and categorize jobs by industry . there could be folders and files
hey this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off
i know my erection is back

thank you
joey , can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?
okay .
phoebe thank you . thank you
pheebs , have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?
i 'm sorry , it 's just , i 'm a little short on cash .
if you want i could loan you some money ?
oh no , no , no . i learned never to borrow money from friends . no , that 's why richard dreyfuss and i don 't speak anymore .
oh , hey , how about this ? wanna be an extra on my show ?
you could do that ?

oh , really ?
no it is awesome

hi guys .

wow hey , why are you all dressed up ?
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone . doesn 't she look cute ?
she sure does . why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?
well , because if one more person says what a cute little boy i 'm gonna whip them with a car antenna
i think she 's gonna be the hit of the office , huh ? she 's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts . can i get a blue bow ?

okay , i have looked through a bunch of career guides , photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .
how long was i in there ?
okay . let us start with the a 's . advertising .
wait . advertising that 's a great idea
don 't you want to look through the rest ?
i don 't think i have to hear the rest . advertising makes perfect sense . sorry you had to waste all this time , though .
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ? ooh , now i get to use my shredder
i mean , i can write slogans . i mean , how hard can it be , right ? cheese . it 's milk that you chew . crackers . because your cheese needs a buddy . a grape . because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?
i got one . socks . because your family 's feet deserve the best .
honey ? leave it to the pros .
i actually know someone in advertising . i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency . maybe i can get him to meet you ? give me the phone .
the phone . bringing you closer to people who have phones .
marriage . it 's not for everybody .

that went well . almost everybody knew that she was a girl .
yeah , after you punched that one guy who got it wrong , word spread .
i 'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . who the hell are you ?
who the hell are you ?
i 'm the hell person whose office this is
good one , rach .
i 'm gavin mitchell , the person who 's taken over your job .
excuse me ?
oh , your baby 's so cute . why did you put a pink bow on a boy ?

joey , look at me i 'm a nurse
yes you are . i think it may be time for my sponge bath . sorry , i 'm just so used to hitting on the extras . so , are you excited about your scene ?
yeah but i 'm a little shaky and nervous .
oh , relax . don 't be . you 'll be fine , you 'll be fine . they 'll probably just make you stand in the back .
okay , okay , okay you . here , come here , here . you 're gonna take this tray , you 're gonna stay on this yellow mark . you 're gonna move on action you 're gonna walk over to the operating table . you 're gonna stop on that blue mark , you 're gonna put the
okay , now . what ?
and action

cut cut
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . i 'm just a little nervous .
well , don 't be .
okay , that helps .
and action

cut
hey , you know what ? don 't worry , pheebs it usually takes me three takes too alright , eight .
and action

so , do you have any other question about advertising ?
no , no . but let me show you what i can do . bagels and donuts . round food for every mood .
monica warned me you might do that . i actually think we might have something for you at the agency .
really ? that 's great
it 's an unpaid internship .
it 's funny . when you said unpaid it sounded like you said unpaid .
come on now . monica has a good job . and it 's not like you have a family to support .
actually , we 're trying , and i don 't think monica 's gonna wanna postpone it . we 're supposed to have sex tonight . actually , she 's probably at home naked right now . i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me . i can just picture her on the bed right now .
stop
okay .

wait a minute what do you mean , you 're taking over my job ?
well , while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job .
a vacation ? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw .
clearly you 've never been to sandles paradise island .
alright don 't get too comfortable there , because i 'm back in two weeks and i want everything back to the way it was . i can 't say that i care too much for the way you 've rearranged my office .
i can 't say i care too much for that smell you 've brought in with you .
excuse me ?
rach we have a code brown situation .
can you please , please take care of it for me ?
alright , but you have to do one sometime .
let me just get this straight so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job ?
well , there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together .
that 's right . you 're very cheeky for a temp .
i 'm not a temp . i was transferred here from another department .
oh yeah , what department was that ? the jerk department ?
oh , they didn 't tell me about your quick wit .
did they mention that i 'm rubber and you 're glue ?
gavin , ralph loved your ideas .
oh , hi mr. zelner .
rachel , i see you 've met gavin . i must say , when you left us we weren 't sure what we were gonna do . but then , gavin to the rescue . super gavin
that 's great . so now , super gavin , when i come back where are you planning on flying off to ?
well , that 's up to mr. zelner . i 'm sure he will make the right decision .
oh , wow . super ass-kissing power .
incidentally , when are you coming back ?
today .
you said two weeks .
no , i said today see , for a superhero , not so much with the listening .

hey .
hey . so , what did he say ?
well , he can be a little rough around the edges , so i 'm gonna replace a word he used a lot , with the word puppy . okay , so he said if your puppy friend doesn 't get her puppy act together , i 'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass .
i 'm sorry , i can 't do this . i 'm not an actor .
that 's right , you 're not . you 're a nurse . you 're nurse with tray .
joey .
no , no . nurse with tray doesn 't know joey , she doesn 't have time for friends . she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor , because if she doesn 't , people die
who dies ?
man with eye patch you get in there and you do your job .
yes , doctor .
okay .
okay , let 's try this one more time .
hang in there , man with eye patch , your tray is coming
and action
yes , i did it i nailed it yay what 's next ?
the rest of the scene .
okay , from the top , people

listen . sudden change of plans . my maternity leave just ended . they told me that if i didn 't come back today , they were gonna fire me .
what ? no , that 's illegal . i 'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won 't even
alright , alright . calm down norma rae . they didn 't actually say that . i 'm just afraid if i don 't come back right now this guy 's gonna try to squeeze me out .
what about emma ? we don 't have a nanny .
i know . you know , we 're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight . can you please just take care of her for today ?
absolutely . just give me your breast and we 'll be on our way .
come on , i don 't know what else to do .
fine , fine . we 'll have fun , won 't we ? yes , we will , yes we will .
ross ?
huh ?
you 're pretty .

whatever i decide to do , i 'm gonna be starting a career from scratch . it 's gonna be a while before i make a living at it . maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .
so you have to tell monica you don 't want to have a baby right now ?
yeah .
good-bye .
okay , it 's baby time . pants off bing . didn 't see you there geller .
yeah , ross is here so
yeah , and i was really hoping that i could hang out . what do you feel like doing ?
we 're gonna have sex .
i don 't feel like having sex . maybe we can watch a movie or something .
let me put it this way . we 're having sex whether you 're here or not .
pants off bing

alright . now that i 'm back , why don 't you just fill me in on what you 've been up to ?
well , i 've changed your screensaver from that picture of nsync .
hey , they were popular when i left
also , i 've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow .
well , i should be involved in that , so why don 't you get me up to speed ?
that 's gonna take weeks . why don 't just let me take care of the presentation ?
oh , no no no no . i see what you 're doing here , alright , listen , this is my job buddy . okay , i 've had it for five years , and i know how it works , so why don 't you just catch me up
fine .
oh god . you 've totally messed with the back support of my chair . how do you fix this ?
hey , you 've been here five years , you figure it out .
fine , i will . alright , fill me in

hey .
hey .
you have a blue tie that would go with this ? emma spit up on mine .
oh , yeah . but you have to give it back if i get a job . of course , by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we 'll all be wearing silver jump suits .
hi , good morning lover . i gotta say after last night , i 'm a little weak in the knees .
here 's an idea . you walk into a room take a quick scan
sorry . but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .
oh god , i have to tell you something . you 're not pregnant .
what are you talking about ?
that thing that i have to do to make a baby . i faked it .
what ? you faked it ?
you know what ? i don 't need a tie . i mean , it 's better , open collar . you know , it 's more casual

joey , listen . i can 't do this , it doesn 't make any sense . yesterday i was a nurse , and today i 'm a waitress at a cafe ?
oh , sometimes we use the same extras for different parts . it 's okay .
well , it 's not okay , because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse . and now suddenly i 'm the waitress ? that 's gonna confuse my fans .
maybe you are a nurse , but you moonlight as a waitress .
uhuh . because i 'm a single mother , supporting my two children .
nice .
wait a minute . dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital . wouldn 't i come over to say hi to him ?
no , no . see , you and drake are having a fight .
about what ?
he slept with you and then never called you .
and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky .
okay , okay , from the top . and action
so , i 'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me .
joey drake i 'm surprised to , but yet here i am .

cut , cut what are you doing ?
yeah , well , i 'm very angry at him , because he slept with me and never called me back .
me too
me too
oh , calm down she means on the show we need some new extras around here

wow , you 're here already .
yes . emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation . i actually made a few changes , but i think i 'm caught up on everything . so ask me anything
how do you fix the chair ?
except that oh , hello , mr. zelner . we 're all ready for our presentation this afternoon .
good , because it 's in ten minutes .
what ? i can 't do that i have the baby , and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour .
well , then gavin can give the presentation , okay , we have to do it now . ralph needs to leave early today . he 's going helicopter shopping .
well , there you go . you win , you win . you get to do the presentation , you 'll knock em dead , no one will ever remember that i worked here , and then ralph will buy his helicopter , and super gavin will just fly right along side of him
you can do the presentation .
no , i can 't , i have a baby .
i 'll watch her .
why would you do that ?
because you 've worked really hard , and it 's your job , and you 're a little crazy .
that 's really nice .
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .
then you 're not gonna like what 's coming . i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . thank you , thank you .
i 'm really fine , don 't worry , i 'm great with children . gavin mitchell . pleased to meet you .

please don 't fire my friend . just let me talk to her .
okay , okay . but this is her last chance .
thank you , thank you . how about i do something for you ? tomorrow , i 'll bring you a hat , cover up the bald ?
hey , listen pheebs . i was just talking to the director , and he was thinking , maybe this time you don 't hit drake , you just wait on the tables ?
i can 't do that . i 'm an actor . i have a process .
you 're a masseuse . you have a table with a hole in it .
wait a minute , i see what 's happening here . you 're threatened .
what ?
yeah , i 'm so good in this scene that i 'm stealing focus from you . well , rise to the challenge tribianni cause i just raised the bar . come join me up here
yeah , you can fire her , but i would call security , she won 't go easy .

you faked it ? you couldn 't have faked it
oh yes you can . you just make the faces and the noises .
guys can fake it ? unbelievable . the one thing that 's ours besides , why would you fake it when we 're trying to have a baby ?
that 's actually why . look , i 'm starting a whole new career now , and i 'm not saying that i don 't want to have a baby , i 'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while .
like a month ?
or a year ?
really , you want to wait a year ?
it could be less than a year . i mean , you 've heard my stuff . pants . like shorts , but longer . it 'll probably be more than a year .
i really wanna have a baby .
yeah , me too . look , i 'll just get my old job back .
no , i want you to have a job that you love . not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .
i quit and you learn what i do ?
it 's just , i think , there 's never gonna be a right time to have a baby . i mean , now you 're unemployed and in a little while you 'll find a new job that 'll keep you really busy . there 's always gonna be a reason not to do this , but i think
i guess . it 's always gonna be scary when we have a baby .
it 's gonna be really scary . i mean , god . when we have a baby , there 's gonna be so much that we 're not able to control . i mean , the apartment 's gonna be a mess , i won 't have time to clean it . what if the baby gets into the ribbon
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?
yes , please
oh , and i promise , i will not fake it this time .
i wish i could say the same . i 'm a little shook up

joey drake i know you botched that operation on purpose . i can 't prove it yet , but when i do , you 'll be going to jail for murder . i don 't care if you are my brother .
i 'm not your brother .
phoebe waitress what about my children drake ? huh ? no no no god

hey you guys
hey happy birthday
shhh don 't say that loud , gunther 's gonna want to hug me .
uh , good news everyone , we finally found a nanny . this is molly . molly , chandler , joey .

no , you stay , i 'll do it .
ok , thank you .
nice to meet you guys .
yeah , you too .

oh , wow , molly is just great
yeah .
yes , bravo on the hot nanny .
what ? you really think she 's hot ?
are you kidding ? if i wasn 't married she 'd be rejecting me right now .
and joey ?
how do you think she 's doing ?
am i the only one who doesn 't think that she 's hot ? ross ?
eh , i mean , i mena she 's not unattractive but hot ? i
thank you
now that rachel 's gone ?
so hot i cried myself to sleep last night .

hey mike , what 's the capital of peru ?
lima .
no . it starts with a v and ends with an x . helpfully with a to in the middle .
you know , kinda think of it , the capital of peru is vtox . oh god oh
what ?
ok , i don 't want to freak you out or anything , but i think i just saw a rat in your cupboard .
oh , whew , no , that 's bob .
what , is he your pet rat ?
well not so much a pet as , you know , an occasional visitor who i put food out for , you know . kinda like santa . except santa doesn 't poop on the plate of cookies .
you can 't keep a rat in your appartment they 're extremely unsanitary , and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus .
what are those ?
i don 't know but they don 't sound like spa treatments . you have to get rid of it
ok , fine , if it means that much to you i 'll get rid of bob .
thank you .
so weird , you think he 's so gross and you 're willing to eat his crackers .

hello .
hello
gavin , i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation . i really owe you an appology .
for what ?
well , when we first met , you know , i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious
is this your first appology ?
no , i just mean that , you know , first impressions don 't mean anything . and i-i think you 're a really good guy and i 'm sorry that i misjudged you .

good morning
hello . but you know what , hey , new day , new leaf , i am just really really happy i 'm sorry , obviously heather 's ass has something more important to say so i 'll just wait till it 's finished .
what ?
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out
i wasn 't checking her out . i 'm in fashion , i was looking at her skirt . or was it pants ? i didn 't really see what happened below the ass area .
oh wow , you are really , you 're really a creep .
why do you even care if i was looking at her ? are you jealous ?
oh yeah , i 'm jealous . oh gavin , please , please look at my ass . stop looking at my ass i mean , i just think you are totally inappropriate , ok ? this is a work environment , she 's your subordinate .
i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .
that is totally different for two reasons . one i didn 't know that you knew that . and two , i wasn 't some creep staring at his ass , we had a deap meaningful relationship .
huh . what 's tag 's last name ?
it was oh my god . he didn 't have a last name . it was just tag . you know , like cher , or , you know , moses .
but it was a deap meaningful relationship .
oh , you know what my first impression of you was absolutely right . you are arrogant , you are pompous morgan morgan tag 's last name was morgan huh
it was jones .
yeah well what are you , his boyfriend ?

man , i wish i had a nanny like you .
you mean , when you were a baby .
sure .

would you stop staring at her ?
i wasn 't staring . i was leering .
what 's the big deal with her ? maybe she 's attractive in an obvious kind of way .
yeah , obvious beauty 's the worst . you know , when it 's right there in your face . me , i like to have to work to find someone attractive . makes me feel like i earned it .
looks like joey is doing allright with her .
yeah . hey , that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once .
i 'm gonna take her back to the appartment .
ok , i 'll be home right after work . ok , by emma-wemma-demma , i love you wovyou dovyou
bye
they 've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk it 's not so good .
i think it 's sweet .
bye , emma-wemma-demma .
hey , listen , joey , about molly , i really prefer if you didn 't go after her .
why not ?
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn 't want anything to , you know , drive her away .
so , what , you think i 'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ? yeah , sounds about right .
come on , there are plenty of other women out thereok ? just just forget about her , ok ? just , she 's off limits .
oh , man , why did have to go and say that for ? now that you told me i can 't have it makes me want her even more
what are you , a child ?
yes
joey , come on now , for me please , just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .
fine .
take me home

hey mikey
hey p
what are you doing ?
setting rat traps .
to kill bob ? ?
no , no , to test his neck strength .
no , mike , i don 't want to kill him i thought we were just gonna capture him and , and you know , set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .
ok , ok , i 'll throw away the traps .
i 'll find bob , i 'll get him . bob ? bob robert oh wait , i think i hear him . oh oh my god bob had babies bob 's a mom
better think of a new name for him .
i don 't know , i kinda like bob for a girl .
i don 't know , i mean i 'm not sure
oh my god , we killed bob
maybe it wasn 't bob , maybe it was a mouse .
suzie ?

whazzup ? ?
seriously dude , 3 years ago .
listen , can you do me a favor ? i 'm gonna be out today . can you just keep an eye on joey , make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?
you don 't trust him ?
wh no . some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter , the hot nanny .
is this really your long term plan , for me to run interference ? because i could get a job any day now .
you do appear right on the cusp of something . come on man , i 'm sure he 'll lose interest in a week or two , but for now can you please just do this for me ?
allright , fine , but don 't blame me if it doesn 't work . because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something , more often than not , he 's going to have sex with it .
well we gotta do something , ok ? nannies like her don 't grow on trees .
picturing that tree ?
i am , yes .

where you going , joe ?

for a walk .
oh . you mind if i join you ?
actually , that will be long . you know , i really need to organize my thoughts .
your thoughts ? plural ?
allright , fine , i only have one thought it 's about the hot nanny , i gotta see her
i 'm afraid i can 't let you do that , joe .
now you 're telling me i can 't see her ? ? you guys are killing me she 's forbidden fruit it 's like like she 's the princess and i 'm the stable boy why are you doing this , huh ? did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?
yes , as a matter of fact he did , so i can 't let you go .
huh . interesting . now there are obstacles . hot nanny and me against the world . this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .
great novels ?
fine mediocre porn

gavin mitchelle 's office .
rachel green 's office give me that phone hello , this is rachel green , how can i help you ? uh huh ok then i 'll pass you back to your son
hey mom no , that 's just my secretary .
um , excuse me gavin , i have a question i need to ask you .
mom , i 'll call you later . yeah . yes ?
if you like looking at butts so much why don 't you just go look at a mirror ?
thank god you finally said that , i saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago . man , i really bug you , don 't i ?
oh , please , i don 't care about you enough to bug me . in fact , from now on , i 'm going take the high road . and i 'm going be very very nice to you , you momma 's boy , starting right now .

hey rach
hi
ready for your birthday lunch ?
yeah i am , i am oh , but first of all , monica , i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet you . so you 're coming to rachel 's party tonight ?
oh no no no no no , gavin can 't , he already has plans , most likely with his mother .
well i don 't mind , i 'll cancel . i would never miss my secretary 's birthday .
why did you invite him ? ? i can 't stand that guy
you were just being so nice to him
i was faking it can 't you tell when i 'm being fake ?

hey , mr philips , nice suit
right there that was so fake
shh

i still can 't believe you invited gavin . allright , he is the last person i want to see .
oh , you 're welcome for the party . i 'm glad you 're having a good time .
god , i hope he doesn 't show up . of course he 's not gonna show up , the guy hates me .
does he ?
what ?
maybe he 's bothering you so much because he likes you . it 's like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ?
oh , monica , you think skippy liked you ? honey , all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over .
she 's out , i 'm gonna take her home .
oh , ok , thank you . do you see what all the guys see in her ?
wouldn 't kick her out of bed . no more vodka for me

hey rach , so can i sing happy birthday to you now ?
yeah , sure
oh happy birth oh , see you later
hey rach , somebody got you shoes
oh , give me
be careful , be careful these are my rat babies
yeah . we have rat babies now .
ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party ?
so this is what a stroke feels like .
i had to bring them we killed their mother , they 're our responsibility now . you know , they require constant care . you should know that , rachel , you 're a mother .
are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?
no seven rats i think we should take them home , we need feed them .
whhh wait , you 're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?
well i 'm sorry rachel , but i 'm not like you , ok ? not everyone can afford help .

where the hell are joey and molly ? i asked you to watch them .
i 'm sorry , i got a little occupied .
we have to stop them before something happens
right behind you , big guy

so you see , molly , what people don 't understand is that acting is a discipline . it takes a lot of hard work .
so where did you study ?
oh , i didn 't go to college .
no , where did you study acting ?
molly people don 't study acting

molly , ah , do you mind giving us just a minute ?
sure , i 'll go check on emma .
thanx .

will the stable boy never get the princess ? ?
what do you think you 're gonna do , have sex with her right here on my couch ?
no the leather sticks to my ass . you know , this isn 't fair . what makes you think that i 'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off ? huh ? can 't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her , and might want something real ? look ,

come on joe
ok

hi , is molly here ?
yeah , come on in . molly ?
hey guys , this is tabatha . i 'll see you tomorrow .
ok well , uh , joey , i guess we have no problem .
it 's like my favorite fairy tale come true the princess , the stable boy and the lesbian

ok , ok , you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed .
hey , when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats ?
well , you know what , they 're our responsibility now .
ok , fine , these rats are our responsibility . what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?
mate ? they 're all brothers and sisters .
yeah not such a problem with rats . no , they 're more of a love the one you 're with kind of animals .
no . wh get off your sister oh my god , what are we gonna do ? we have 7 rats . so what if each of them has 7 rats ? and then each of those have 7 rats ? that 's like that 's math i can 't even do what are we gonna do ?
well , i know this is gonna sound crazy , but , we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .
yeah , ok . i guess you 're right . allright , so we should just give them away . but to nice families , with children , and reduced fat wheat thins . they 're bob 's favorites .
it 's gonna be ok .
you must think i 'm crazy .
no , i think you 're sweet .
good . it 's just so hard , it 's hard for me to let them go . i guess it just brings back memories , you know , from when i gave birth to my brother 's triplets and i had to give them up . i haven 't told you about that yet , have i ?

hey
hi . thanks for the party , honey . should i help you clean up ?
no way you had your party , now i have mine is everything alright ?
yeah , i just get a little bummed when my birthday 's over .
well , at least you have one thing to be happy about . that jerk gavin from your office didn 't show up .
mmm hmm .
yeah , hey .
oh , we weren 't talking about you . no , no way to recover .
no .

nice party .
well , it was , and you would have seen it if you didn 't showed up at 9 30 ? ? god oh , this party was lame
again , you 're welcome .
look , i 'll just give you this and go .
oh , you bought me a present why ?
well , let me explain how birthday parties usually work . there are presents , and a cake , perhaps a fourth or fifth person . ok , i got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier .
aww . well , ok , well that 's very nice . and you wrote a card . from gavin
i really mean it .
awww , awww , it 's beautiful .
you don 't mind ? well , what do you know , it fits
see , gavin , you 're capable of being a nice guy . why did you give me such a hard time ?
i 'm not sure .
well monica seems to think it 's because you have feelings for me .
i do have feelings for you .
you do ?
yes , i feel that you are a little annoying .
see ? why , gavin , why ? right when i 'm about to change my opinion of you , you go and you and you do that

first i was afraid , i was petrified
hey
hi
listen , i think i 've left something here .
oh , well someone left this . this is yours ?
no , but i like it . i think i left one of my rat babies .
oh , uh , well , i haven 't seem it but if i do i 'll let you know .
ohmygod rat baby rat baby rat baby

hey
yeah yeah ok sure look can we can we talk about what happened here last night ?
sure just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn 't do i mean come on
ok you you really don 't know what i am talking about ?
no
ok last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .
our balcony ? seriously ? that 's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony . and she said no , no . it 's too cold , nobody will go out there . and i said maybe if we put some light out there they will
right that 's why i came over to talk about . hum i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony , even though there were no lights
so are you gonna talk to her ?
why why should i ? i mean if she wants to move on , that 's fine
you know when that 's fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits
no i 'm serious . i mean she wants to date people ? fine i don 't care but at least she could have told me . you know i i 've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows , then so will
no no no . good . so you 're moving on ? do you have any idea where you 're moving ?
i don 't know . i mean i have plenty of opportunity . just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me . and then the other day on the subway a woman accidentally sat on my hand .
dude , don 't rub my face in your crazy single life
well , and how about this ? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental potluck dinner .
why did i get married ?

hey let me ask you guys something . i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed . is that weird for a guy ?
well it depends .
on ?
on how far along he 's in the sex change process
no i totally disagree . no i think it 's fine for a guy to do something like that . such you an actor . not that you need to , your eyebrows are
ok stop it you guys stop staring you 're freaking me out
your knuckles are kinda hairy too
oh man i have to get those done too ?
wow talking about high maintenance
hey hey you dye your hair
i 'm a woman
arghhh double standards
oh before i forget , are you coming to mike 's piano bar tonight ?
only if i don 't have to get up and sing .
but everybody sings . it 's so much fun last time this adorable old man got out there , forgot all of the words , flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage . so funny .
it 's just , i 'm not good at singing .
oh what 's the matter ? are you scared ? you 're afraid i 'm a better singer ? you 're afraid i 'm gonna beat you at singing ?
no no , it 's not working on me . wow i must be growing up
ok fine please come and support mike . you don 't have to sing .
so i don 't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others ?
while drinking
i 'm there
hi guys listen i really need your help . i think i did something really stupid .
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
no not that . i kissed gavin last night .
oh my god .
you kissed him ?
yeah . it was after the party , we were on the balcony and
wait wait wait . i was at home the whole time . how did i missed that ?
it was the end of the party , you were probably ironing wrapping paper .
oh yeah so how did you end up kissing ?
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and , oh and he gave me this scarf
i thought you hated him ?
you know honey , there is a thin line between love and hate , and it turns out that line is a scarf
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?
i don 't know . it 's so complicated . i work with this guy , you know , i have the baby , and i have ross , and i just i don 't know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .
sounds like you need to think about what you want , talk to gavin , and you definitely should talk to ross
or i could call in sick and not deal with it at all
wow five-month maternity leave , you 're back for four days , kiss a co-worker , call in sick , they are lucky to have you

hey it 's the most eligible man in ny . how 's the moving on going ?
not well . i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .
well maybe you 're going about this the wrong way . you know i mean think about it . single white male , divorced three times , two illegitimate children . the personal ad writes itself
that 's funny do you think you 'll ever work again ?
what are doing ? you know i can only dish it out
i can 't believe rachel just moved on and didn 't say anything to me
maybe she didn 't move on , you know maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
no no , about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .
did she go out with him ?
no . when he called , i i threw the message away .
ah the high road
you know what ? enough enough talking i have to get moving hey check out those two blondes over there hey come with me
are you trying to get everybody divorced ?
you don 't have to do anything . it will just be easier if it is the two of us , like college , remember ? you you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you 're the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation , so they 'll see that i
i thought i had to make the jokes
don 't you have to be at work ?
oh come on hello hi my name is chandler , here 's my friend ross right here , and we were wondering you know if you 're up for it . we only need six more people for a human pyramid swoop swoop
hum so hum oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper another flood in europe ? heres a question would you would you rather drown or be burnt alive ?
sorry we were just leaving
we still got it

who is it ?
gavin i brought you some soup .
why ?
i heard you were sick
oh right yeah hold on , i 'll be just clean up in here a little bit hello gavin
i missed you at work today . how are you feeling ?
i a not gonna lie to you , i 'm pretty sick
oh good because i was having a totally paranoid moment when i thought you called in sick to avoid me .
oh no no no
so i had fun last night
so did i
exactly how contagious is this thing you have ? i mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you ?
it 's just a cold
do you have fever ? let me see . hum
what ? what 's the matter ?
what 's ross doing to you on that picture ?
oh he 's dusting me with a fossil brush . he thought it would be funny .
right . right . ross . so what 's the deal with you guys ? i don 't want to get in the middle of anything
oh you 're not . you 're not gonna get in the middle of anything , don 't worry about ross really , really . oh hide that 's ross hide hide
yeah but you said not to worry about
i lied and i 'm not sick just stay behind the curtain
hi
oh molly you 're not ross .
no i 'm here to take emma to your mother 's , remember ?
right , right , yes
don 't panic
what ?
there is a man behind your curtain . i have a mace in my purse .
no that 's ok that 's ok that 's ok no no no no this is my business associate gavin . he 's just being silly . gavin come out from behind that curtain
hi gavin please to meet you . it was my idea to stand there .
hello i just go and get emma .
ok .
so hum why did i have to hide ?
i thought it was ross .
so what if it was ? i thought there was nothing going on between you two
there isn 't . there is totally isn 't .
you hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time . i used to be a rodeo clown .
all right . look . gavin i i guess i felt guilty that you were here , which i shouldn 't . you know ross and i are not in any relationship but he is the father of my child , and you know we do live together and plus there is just so much history you know it 's
it 's ok . i know it 's probably not my place but can i give you a piece of advice ?
yes
i think you should talk to ross about all this .
people keep saying that . oh i 'm sorry gavin
don 't be . it 's just bad timing .
so seriously rodeo clown ?
one of the best , ma 'am , one of the best

no time for losers , cause we are the champions of the world thank you

oh she 's my girlfriend . that 's not just how we do it here . i got to get a break and when we come back we 've got kenneth singing i touch myself i 'm not here to judge
hi hi oh you have got to sing .
no i told you i can 't .
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice .
what have you heard me sing ?
all the time when you 're cooking .
what ?
yeah you 're always singing yummy yummy yummy , i 've got love in my tummy
yeah i do rock that one .
ok so isn 't there a little part of you that wants to get up there ?
just a little but it 's just so scary i don 't even know what i would sing
well i 've got a book around
delta dawn

hi i could help not notice , but that 's an unusual necklace
you already hit on me an hour ago
right , so that 's a firm no . i cannot believe this , i just keep striking out .
i don 't get it neither , i mean you 're obviously desperate , you 're asking women how they want to be killed
this is great . rachel 's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i 'm gonna die alone .
by drowning or ?
why would he break up with me ?
i don 't know sweetie .
all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back . i mean , am i so unlovable ?
well
i know

all right , that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of i touch myself . coming up next we 've got monica singing delta dawn .
wait wait i can 't sing in front of all these people .
just pretend they 're not even here it 's ok monica , when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won 't see anyone anyway .
hi i 'm monica and i 'm gonna be singing delta dawn delta dawn , what 's that flower you have on ? could it be a faded rose from days gone by ?
can you totally see through her shirt ?
like an x-ray . bad day not to wear a bra .
to take you to his mansion in the sky-y ?

yeah .
comb my eyelashes .

oh youll probably take care of that on your hands .
i am sorry i am late . youll understand when youll see joey .

and they love me
oh my god
yes , she gives the people what they want .

i gotta stop this .
oh , who cares , they still love me i am so excited
you , touching yourself , out

wow . she does that a lot
ross , you didnt tell me you were a doctor
what , what , wait a minute you havent even told her you were a doctor , yet ? how long have you known her , like an hour ?
actually about an hour and a half .
i told you it wasnt long , but there is an amazing connection between us .
you feel that too ? oh , i thought that was just me
are you kidding ?
hey , do you want to go away this weekend ?
well see .
ok , ross , whats going on here , are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?
i dont know , are we just kissing guys on balconies ?
how do you know about that ?
through the magic of sight i was here , putting our child to sleep
emma .
when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know , for what ? a week ?
oh , thats what this is all about ? did you bring her up here to get back at me ?
no , actually , see i had to pee , cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites .
ok , michelle , its time to go .
well , call me
ok .
no , wait , you dont have my phone number
you know , if its meant to be , ill guess it . bye , bye .
score .
oh , i am sorry , did you not like her , because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on the balcony .
oh god , i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this . it was one kiss , one guy , one time
oh , really
yeah .
oh , really
oh yeah .
what about the guy from the bar ?
what ? who ?
the guy you gave your number to .
whoa , how do you know about that ?
because he called here looking for you . so dont tell me this this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing , ok ? youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now . and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .
why didnt i get that message ?
what ?
from the guy in the bar , why didnt i get that message ?
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket . do you do you not look there ?
ross ?
i never gave it to you .
why ?
i dont know .
oh god . you know what ? who you think you are ? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?
who am i ?
yes .
i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys
oh my god , i cannot believe this . you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me thats not the point . ok ? the point is you you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone
oh , ross , this is just so messed up whats wrong with us ? you know when people hear about our situation they always ask , what , you live together but youre not a couple ? and you have a baby , isnt that weird ? and i say no . you know what , its not ,
uh , clearly .
and you know , we said that we would , we would live together as long as this makes sense . an maybe this , you know , just doesnt make sense anymore .
yeah , maybe not . so what you wanna do ?

hey
hi . can emma and i live here for a while ?
ha , oh , of course .
thank you .
your eyebrows look weird .

jeremiah was a bullfrog . was a good friend of mine , never understood a single word he said , but i helped him drink his wine . so you just touch yourself for anything ?
transcribed by marita bakken

morning , roomie
hey you remembered to put clothes on this morning .
fifth day 's a charm .
oh , joey , it 's so great to be back here . i gotta tell you , you 're making it so easy on me and emma .
hey , it 's great having you back . you know , stay as long as you want , and when does she stop crying all night ?

hey , you 're not naked so hey , rach , when will we expect to see you tonight ?
well , i 'll probably be back to pick her up around six , but she 's in the bedroom all ready to go . but she did actually fall back to sleep , so
she 's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .
bye

bye hey , i hope emma isn 't making it too hard on you .
no , hey , it 's been great .
yeah ?
yeah . and look , i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything , all my feelings from before are totally over , okay ? and even if they weren 't , when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump
yeah , that 'll do it .
wow so , how are you ?
i 'm , i 'm okay .
really ?
sure , i mean , do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ? of course . you know , i 'm disappointed , but it 's not like it 's a divorce .
well , actually it
no , it 's not a divorce , it is not a divorce anyway , i think rachel and i need to , you know , get on with our lives , maybe , maybe start seeing other people .
wow , really ?
yeah , sure , why not ? in fact , if you know anyone that would be good for me
sure , i know lots of girls .
yeah ? any names come to mind ?
ooh , names ?

hey .
hey . i was just gonna get something to eat . you want something ?
what you got ?
okay , let 's see , we got strained peas , strained carrots ooh strained plums . we haven 't tried that yet .
goodie thanks . so , how is it living with rachel again ? i mean , apart from the great food .
i 'm fine , i 'm fine , it 's just , it 's just weird what 's happening with her and ross . you know , yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .
oh my god , rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .
why are they doing this ?
i don 't know . they 're so perfect for each other it 's crazy .
you know what 's crazy ? these jars . what is it , like two bites in here ?
i just wish they 'd realise they should be together .
i know , i know . and when they moved back in together , i figured y 'know , that 's where things were headed .
i know . they should be a family . they should get married and have more children .
yes , and they should name one of their kids joey . i may not have kids someone 's gotta carry on the family name .
you know what ? maybe once they start dating , and they see what 's out there , they 'll realise how good they are for each other .
yeah , because it is slim pickings . i had this date last night yuck but we should probably keep it down she 's still in the bedroom .
so , what are we gonna do ? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?
i know that just pushes them further and further apart .
yeah . oh , i know what we can do . we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates , so that they 'll realise how good they are together .
ooh , that 's a great plan
yeah , you know what the best part of it is ? i get to do my plan-laugh .

shhh not so loud , we don 't wanna wake up , uh

hey
hey
you guys aren 't doing anything tonight , are you ?
see , now , why would you assume that ? just because we 're married ? i will have you know that we are very hip , happening people . now , if you 'll excuse me , i have to get back to reading the obituaries .
i was just asking cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .
sure , we 'll do that . what are you up to ?
well , phoebe set me up on a date .
oh my god .
wow .
why ? what 's the big deal ?
just figured , cause you and ross are
what , slept together a year and a half ago ? yeah , i 'm all set .
well , i think it 's great that you 're going on a date , you know ? i mean , it sounds healthy . i mean , you have needs . embrace your womanhood
you want a job ? turn off oprah , and send out a resume
so i 'll bring her by around seven ? is that okay ?
oh , it 's perfect .
oh , you guys are gonna have so much fun she 's at such a cute age . oh , a couple things . now that she 's eating solid food , she poops around the clock . and watch out for your hair , cause she likes to grab it . and oh , she 's also in this
suddenly i wish i was reading my own name .

ooh , joey .
hey .
hey . i 'm so excited i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .
all right who is he ?
well , it 's this guy i used to massage . and by massage , i mean hold down so he wouldn 't turn over and flash me .
okay , okay . wait till you hear who i got for ross .
oh , yeah .

she 's this really boring woman . she 's a teacher
a teacher ?
yeah , yeah , she 's really into history and foreign movies and oh , oh , she loves puzzles . huh ? come on , who loves puzzles ?
well , ross does . what you 're you 're ruining the plan joey , you 've you 've fixed him up with his perfect woman
oh my god , you 're right
yeah .
she even reads for pleasure
how do you even know a woman like that ?
what ? i 'm not allowed to know smart women ?
joey .
i met her at the library . i went in to pee .
so now what do we do ?
well , okay , i 'll i 'll just call her and tell her the date 's cancelled , and find him somebody else .
what if we don 't find him somebody else ? we 'll just tell her the date 's off , but we don 't tell ross , and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up
ooh i hear that 's bad .
ooh , so this is great rachel 's gonna have a terrible date , ross gets stood up , and then they 'll realise how good they have it together .
ah , yes , the plan
it 's not santa 's plan . no , it 's

yeah , you know , it 's not that fun .
no , i think we killed it .

emma ? emma ? look at me well , i think i 'll go downstairs for a while .

no , no , no , no no , no , no , no it 's okay , it 's okay . i didn 't go . don 't cry , it 's just a bit i 'm your uncle chandler funny is all i have

okay , just so you know , i 'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth , so don 't touch yourself in the next 48 hours .
i don 't do that .

i 'll try to stop . wait , did you say until the sixth ?
yeah .
today is the sixth .
no , it 's not .

yes , it 's also 2003 .
oh my god . today 's the sixth ? i may be done ovulating i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant .
it 's okay . go take the test and see if we 're okay .
okay .

tough crib .
hey , where are all my ovulation-sticks ? there 's only one here .
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times .
chandler
i am not working . there 's not much to do around here

excuse me , is there a woman waiting at the bar ? someone average height , dark hair , perhaps doing a puzzle ?
uh , there 's a drunk chinese guy .
well , if i 'm still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me .
can i get you another glass of wine ?
nah , i don 't know if i should . i don 't wanna be drunk when i go home alone .
got stood up , huh ?
yeah , it 's no big deal . it 's just a blind date .
are you worried your date came , saw you , and left ?
no

we 're okay . i 'm still ovulating .
oh , good , because as of four o 'clock this afternoon , i am not .
so , let 's do this .
i i don 't think i can .
come on . i know you 're not eighteen anymore , but give it a minute .
because of emma .
oh my god , emma . oh , sweetie , i forgot you were here . oh , you 're right , we can 't do this . we can 't leave her alone .
sorry .
unless maybe we do it here . i mean , how much can she even be aware of at this age ?
well , she 's aware when we leave the room . she may notice if we start canoodling in it .
canoodling ?
well , i can 't say hump or screw in front of the b-a-b-y .
i don 't know . i mean , i guess having sex in front of a baby isn 't so
horrifying ? scarring ? something people go to jail for ?
i guess you 're right .
you guess i 'm right ? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast , you wouldn 't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .
but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer ?

wow , everything looks so good i think i 'm gonna have the chicken .
i i just have to say this you 're really beautiful .
oh , well , that 's that 's very sweet . thank you .
i 'm kind of funny looking .
what ?
oh , come on , you 're way out of my league . everybody in here knows it . bet that guy over there 's probably saying , ooh , why she out with him ? he must be rich well , i 'm not
so , what do think you wanna order ? i 'm really excited about that chicken .
i 'm not funny either . so , if you were thinking , well , he 's not that good-looking , but maybe we 'll have some laughs that ain 't gonna happen .
well , come on , steve let 's not rule out nervous laughter . hey , now wait a minute . phoebe told me that that you owned your own restaurant . that 's impressive .
i lost it . to drugs .

i silk-screen t-shirts now .
really ? what 's that like ?
it 's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money . that 's right . i have no money , i 'm not funny , i live in a studio apartment with two other guys , and i 'm pretty sure i 'm infertile .
now , come on , come on , steve . there must be something that you like about yourself .
i do like my hair .
really ?

hello ?

phoebe , it 's me . i 'm going to hunt you down and kill you
hey , rach
this is the worst date ever . how could you set me up with this creep ?
you know , you are talking about one of my dear , dear friends .
i don 't care this guy is a nightmare
oh , right , so he gets a little crazy when he 's stoned .
he 's not stoned .
did he go out for a cigarette ?
yeah , four times .
my dear , sweet rach .

well , our plan is working . rachel is having a miserable time , and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone .
oh , great , pretty soon they 'll be back together .
by the time anyone 's figured out what we 've done , we 'll be in sunny mexico . oh , wait , that 's the end of a different plan .

she 's asleep . chandler ?

what are you doing ?
emma was doing it
she 's asleep .
ooh , she 's asleep , that means we can
yes , but we have to be fast .
okay , i 'll try . and you can 't make any noise .
okay , i 'll try .

hello ?

emma ? hey hi

how are ya ? how are ya ? where are your babysitters , huh ? why 's the bedroom door closed ?

you can 't have s-e-x , when you 're taking care of the b-a-b-i-e

i 've got bad news . the chinese guy left .
eh , if it was meant to be , it 's meant to be .
look you got stood up , who cares ? we 're gonna show you a good time . just sit and relax . in fact , let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house .
wow , free crab cakes . well , that 's nice . although i was hoping to have sex tonight .
ooh

just the crab cakes .

waiter 2 what are you doing ? are you trying to get him to stay ? because you can 't do that .
just get out of here , okay ?
what 's what 's going on ?
eh , okay , the waiters have a little pool going . we have a bet on how long it 'll take before you give up and go home .
what ? you you 're making money off my misery ?
well , if you stay till 9 20 , i am .
this is unbelievable . i i have never been so insulted in my life . now , if you 'll wrap up my free crab cakes , i 'll be on my way .

well , that was weird . you were loud , and i was fast .
i think we may have really done it this time .
oh , i wish i didn 't have to wait to take a pregnancy test .
you may wanna get some more of those too .

where 's emma ?
oh my god , where 's emma ? where 's emma ?
don 't ask me , i was in there canoodling you
okay , okay , i 'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma . you go look across the hall , and i 'll call her cell .
okay .
hey , you better hope that we 're pregnant , because one way or another , we 're giving a baby back to rachel .

i i can 't believe i  m crying in front of you . you must think i 'm so pathetic .
no , no , no , i admire a man who can cry .
really ?

don 't touch my coat

oh , sorry , it 's my phone . hello ?
hey , rach , how 's it going ?
oh my god , this is the worst date ever

look , you know what , i 'm sorry , but did you really think that this was going well ? what 's up ?
hey , did you stop by here ?
no .
oh my god , then

oh , thank god emma , there you are
what ? what do you mean , there you are ? where was she ?
oh , we were playing peek-a-boo . she just  she loves it when i 'm dramatic .

why the hell did you take her ?
because you two were having sex
no , we weren 't
don 't you lie to me i could tell by chandler 's hair . you are so lazy . can 't you get on top for once ?
all right , all right , we were . we were trying to make a baby . monica 's ovulating .
hey it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room . i 'm gonna have to tell rachel about this .

no , no , no .
no , please don 't . please , joey . she will kill us
hey , i gotta unless
unless what ?
unless you name your firstborn child joey .
what ? why ?
hey , i may never have kids , and somebody 's gotta carry on my family name .
your family name is tribbiani .
you almost had me .

well , uh
look , i think i know the answer to this question , but would you like to make love to me ?
really , really not .
eh , it 's just as well . doesn 't work anyway .
all right , well that 's good to know . good night , steve .

hey , what 's wrong ?
i just had a rough night .
oh . crab cake ?
eww
well , what happened ?
oh , well , i it 's kind of weird talking to you about this , but
monica told me you had a blind date .
yeah .
i did , too .
oh .
but is it technically a date if the other person doesn 't show up ?
oh , oh no . do you think she walked in , saw you and left ?
why does everyone keep saying that ?
well , if it makes you feel any better , i wish my date hadn 't shown up .
that bad ?
well , he makes t-shirts for a living , and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .

female body inspector ? what size is that ?

now , wait a minute . so , they 're gonna name their first child joey ?
uh-huh .
how how do i get them to name the next one after me ?
it 's easy , you just walk in on them having sex .
oh , so they owe me like , three phoebes .

oh my god look , it 's ross and rachel . oh , the plan is working .

don 't , don 't do the plan-laugh .

the first date we 've had in months , and they were both such disasters .
oh . huh . you know , it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn 't even show .
wait a minute you don 't think it was intentional ? i mean , that 's just stupid .

we 're geniuses yeah , look at them , look at them , they 're really bonding .
oh , yeah , they 're falling in love all over again .

oh , they see us oh , they , they look mad . oh , they figured it out . they 're coming this way . run

i know . a double blind date , and we both get stood up . what are the chances ?
i know , i 'm so bummed . can we have our free crab cakes now ?
what ?
we 've been stood up . and we want our free crab cakes .
guys , give it a rest . nobody 's betting on you tonight . although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry .

i have such fat hands

hey ready to go ?
oh yeah , let me just finish this .
hey ross , check this out yeah , i can 't do that
what are you doin ?
have you seen this ? it 's a new alumni website for college it 's cool you can post messages for people , let everyone know what you 're up to .
great , a faster way to tell people that i 'm unemployed and childless .
it 's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing remember andrea rich ?
the tall girl who wouldn 't sleep with you ?
uh uh well , her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident
bet she 'd sleep with you now
no i already e-mailed her .
let me see what you wrote about yourself doctor paleontology , two kids you split with carol because you have different interests ? i think you split with carol because you 've one very similar interest
you know what ? i 'm gonna finish this later , ok ? let me just grab my coat .
hey
what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ? ?
maybe we finish this for him also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab . she 's now my girlfriend . i don 't care what society says . it 's the best sex i 've ever had aaand send
no , no , no what do you can 't do that to him
alright , let 's go
dude
i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house
aaand send

hey how was basketball ?
oh , it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye
oh , no who did that ?
chandler hey rach what 's hugsy doin in the crib with emma ?
she was just crawling around and she found him , so i just let her sleep with him . that 's all right ? isn 't it ?
oh , yeah of course yeah it 's a stuffed animal you know it 's for kids not for adults i know that
joey are you sure ? i mean , i know how much you love him
rachel let 's be clear on this , ok ? i do not love hugsy . i like him a normal amount
all right oh , emma loves him
why wouldn 't she ? he 's a wonderful person

hi .
hey phoebe how you doin ? you feelin better ?
breaking up sucks oh , i really miss mike
oh , i 'm so sorry
oh god , i tried everything to make myself feel better . i even tried writing a song about it but i can 't think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh hey monica , i really need your help getting through this
you 're not gonna need my help ?
well no , when i get to the point where you know i 'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike i 'm gonna come to you .
oh good , cause i 've already thought of 3 4 i 've just thought of a fourth
ok . i mean i know i did the right thing . you know , mike never wants to get married and i shouldn 't be in a relationship that has no future but pretty soon i 'm gonna miss him so much . i 'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that
ok , you got it
unless maybe it 's too crazy about this alright so you know , there is no future but that doesn 't mean we still can 't have fun . you know what ? forget what i said .
really ? if that 's what you want
that was a test and you just failed .
damn it rookie mistake

i have sex with dinosaurs ? ?
i believe i read that somewhere
that only is not funny , it 's physically impossible ok ? depending on the species i 'd have to have a six foot long it 's not funny
i respectfully disagree .
i can 't believe you put that on my alumni page
who cares ? nobody reads those things
you 'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .
i don 't have a page .
oh oh oh i respectfully disagree

look at you , all sweet and innocent , sleeping like an angel with emma 's chubby little hands wrapped around ya . it 's okay , emma , you stay asleep .
step away from the crib , i have a weapon
it 's okay , it 's okay rach , it 's me . put down the scrunchy .
what are you doing ?
well , i heard emma stirring , so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy .
oh , oh thanks . alright well , now that i 'm up i 'm going to go to the bathroom .
there you go sweetie this isn 't over .

alright , wait a second , why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as gay as the day is long ?
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .
but that 's clearly a joke . this could easily be true .
would you get that please ? people have been calling to congratulate me all day .
hello ? no , he 's not here . yeah , this is his wife . yeah , well , it came as quite a shock to me too . i guess i should have known . yeah , i mean , he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .
hang up , hang up . and that was a great movie i 'm so gonna get back at ross oh yeah , this will show him , here we go .
what are you doing ?
oh , you 'll see my friend .

i 'm dead ?
and so young .
posting that i died ? that really isn 't funny .
well , how you died was funny .
oh please , hit by a blimp ?
it kills over one americans every year .
unbelievable , my classmates are gonna think i 'm dead , my professors , my my parents are gonna get phone calls . you 're messing with people 's feelings here .
you wanna talk about people 's feelings ? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn 't be able to go with him to key west
you 've really crossed the line here , but that 's okay , it 's ok cause i 'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn . that 's right your coming out is about to get real graphic .

god , i wish mike were here .
okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing ?

what are you , animals ? it 's 4 o 'clock in the afternoon
i gotta call him . just to talk to him , there 's no harm in that .
phoebe , that 's how it starts . i don 't need to eat the cake , i 'll just smell the icing why don 't i just eat a little sliver , or , okay , just a slice or two . and next thing you know , you 're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down
here .
and now your cell .
okay
this is your cellphone ?
yes .
this is your current cellphone ?
yes , it reminds me of a simpler time .
phoebe , where 's your purse ?

no , no give it to me
you can 't have it .
give it to me
no
i 'll go in there .
oh yeah .
phoebe come here

haha
damn you monica geller hyphen bing

hey , look who 's here it 's joey , and he brought home a friend .
joey , emma 's right here you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore .
no , no , it 's not a girl , it 's a brand new hugsy
oh that 's so great , now emma has two hugsy 's .
no , no , emma has one hugsy , the new hugsy , huh ? the other hugsy , i don 't know , i guess i 'll just take it back .
oh you know what ? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton . oh i loved her so much , i took her everywhere , i would braid her tail
make the transfer
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can 't find it ?
oh , no don 't worry about that , i swallowed that years ago .

oh , i don 't think she likes the new hugsy .
but he 's the same .
yeah , i think she wants the old one back .
but he 's the same .
joey , come on
he 's the same

you 're not the same

haha
you know , it 's a lot less surprising to do that after i 've buzzed you into the building .
so phoebe , why are there men 's shoes by the door .
those are my shoes .
oh , when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping .
monica , i really appreciate you checking in on me , but i 'm actually feeling a lot better . yeah , i just kinda want to be alone right now .

who 's that ?
i ordered chinese food .

what are the chances ? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike ?
what are you doing here ?
phoebe called me .
phoebe
i 'm sorry , i broke down i wanted to see him .
damnit phoebe how did you even call him ?
there is a speakerphone on the base unit
base unit think monica think
look , if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see
this doesn 't concern you
oh sorry , i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name
look , guys , you can 't do this , it 's just going to make getting over each other , that much harder .
not if nothing happens . why can 't why can 't we just hang out as friends ?
sure if you 're just gonna hang out as friends , then maybe i 'll join ya . you know , i 'm your friend and mike 's friend .
sit down .

oh wow wow wow make room for your friend
so how 've you been ?
i 've been pretty good
you look really beautiful .
thanks , you look good too .
oh no no no no this is dangerous territory . keep it clean
so how 's the piano playing going ?
actually i 've been playing a lot of love songs lately . i 've missed you .
i 've missed you too .

you know , on the way over here , i saw this drunk guy throw up . and then a pigeon ate it

hey , ross , i just wanted to apologize don 't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?
uhu uhu , check this out .
huh so that 's what i would look like if i worked out and was being serviced by a policeman . you 're not actually going to send these out are ya ?
eh actually no , i don 't need to because your little ross is dead joke didn 't work , ok , there were no responses . nobody posted anything on the website , nobody called my parents , so the joke my friend is on you . nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that i 'm
no , come on , you know that 's not true .
what are you talking about ? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet i didn 't get one response and i 'm dead
well , the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .
i can 't believe this . not even my geology lab partner ? and i carried that guy
alright look , let 's think about this , ok , do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ? that people are gonna post condolences on a website ? this is not about people not caring that you 're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their
you 're right . there isn 't a decent outlet .
right , i mean , come on , i 'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service , tons of people would come .
exactly
ross , what 're you what 're you what are you doing ? you 're having a memorial service for yourself ?
no that would be stupid you 're having it for me
ross , don 't press send , don 't press se
oh , too late , too late it 's sent oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man

i 'm trying to put emma down for a nap , have you seen hugsy ?
original or crappy ?
original .
no , sorry haven 't seen him .
then what 's that big lump under your covers ?
it 's monica , ok ?
that 's not monica
alright fine it 's original hugsy no , now i know that emma wants him but he 's mine and i need him
oh god .
she 's being unreasonable
joey , there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don 't cover its ears it 's because it reminds her of her uncle joey
it does ?
yeah and she 's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .
really ? she she loves me ?
oh yeah but you know what ? if you need hugsy , don 't worry . emma will totally understand . i won 't but whatever .
ok , wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute , i mean rach , i mean if if . if hugsy means that much to emma then well she can have him .
oooh you 're sweet , i knew uncle joey would step up . look emma , look who 's baaack
look forget it forget it i can 't do it .
are you gonna you 're going to take hugsy away from a little child ?
how do you think i got him in the first place ?

alright you two , i 'm gonna go to the bathroom . now i don 't want anything going on while i 'm gone . here 's a few things you can discuss mucus , fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it .
i 've missed you so much no , i 'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things , but just to be with you one more night .
i know , i want that too , but is that going to make it too hard ?
it can 't be any harder than this i mean , if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time , i i would have stopped to memorize your face , the way you move , everything about you . if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the
kiss him , you fool
what ?
didn 't you hear that speech ? if you don 't kiss him then i will
oh , i missed you so much
i knew you 'd be here
oh , crap

my friend manny . i asked him to keep me away from you .
hi , that 's what i 'm doing for phoebe
well , you are not doing a very good job
excuse me ?
what 's with the kissing ?
hey , at least i knew where my guy was .
oh yeah yeah , thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing
you didn 't hear the speech
i 've heard the speech if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her
hey , it was very moving you 're just heartless
you 're weak
you 're weird
your pants are undone
oh

oh , actually i barely knew him . yeah , i came because i heard chandler 's news . d 'you know if he 's seeing anyone ?

ok tommy , that 's enough mourning for you here we go , bye bye
hey , listen . call me .
ok
i 'm dead and no one cares ?
i look like a man ? ?
please , one ridiculous problem at a time
it isn 't ridiculous , look around no one 's here
you gave them one day 's notice , not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica it 's probably the way you stand
yes , you 're right . still somebody must have seen it i mean , i went to that school for 4 years , i didn 't have an impact on anyone ?
oh , that 's not true . you had an impact on me , i mean , it 's 15 years later and we 're still best friends . doesn 't that count for something ?
yeah

i 'm sure it 's somebody for you . now , go hide .

hi . i 'm here for ross geller 's memorial service .
kori ? kori weston ?
yeah
wow you look amazing
and you are
chandler , chandler bing . i 'm not gay , i 'm not gay at all .
you are married though .
don 't listen to him , he 's in a really bad mood
i can 't believe that ross is gone . it is just so sad .
i didn 't know ross and you were so close .
we weren 't but we had one class together . he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science . i always remembered him .
i 'm sure that would mean a lot to him . and if heaven has a door , i 'm sure he 's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out . i guess i really missed my chance .
but you didn 't i 'm still alive kori , i know this is a big surprise for you . it 's a long story but the things you just said really made my day i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people
you sick freak , who does that ? i can 't believe i had a crush on you
did you hear that ? kori weston had a crush on me

no mum , i 'm not dead . i know it 's not something to kid about . it was just a practical joke between chandler and me , but it 's over , ok ? actually no , even if i had died , you would not be left childless . monica ?

monica , hey , can i borrow the porsche ?
ok .
alright
but ehm what is it not ?
a place to entertain my lady friends .
and what else is it not ?
a place to eat spaghetti .
very good what do you need it for anyway ?
oh well , the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don 't sell tickets here in new york , so
oh so you 're driving up to connecticut ?
yeah connecticut not west virginia .
hey , maybe i 'll drive you up there i 'd like to buy some tickets myself
uh
yeah with chandler not getting paid , we could really use 300 million dollars .
yeah , because if i was at my old job we 'd say 300 million ? no thank you
hey will you get me tickets too ?
yeah me too. oh i have an idea . why don 't we all pitch in 50 bucks , we 'll pool our money together and then if we win , we 'll split it
yeah thats a great idea
no thanks
you don 't wanna win the lottery ?
uh sure i do , and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart .
still on amelia earhart ?
the woman just vanished
seriously , ross , you don 't want in on this ?
no do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ? i i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .
yes but there 's six of us so we 'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times .
i like those odds
seriously you guys , i can 't believe you 're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery , i mean that 's such a bunch of boohaki .
i 'll ask . boohaki ?
oh oh , we think emma is about to start talking so we 're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm boohaki , goshdarnit and brotherpucker .
how do you know she 's gonna start talking ?
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i 'm saying .
kinda like joey .
what 's that now ?

god look at all these tickets it 's so exciting you know i haven 't won anything since the sixth grade .
pie eating contest ?
oh you assume because i was heavy that 's the only way i could win something ?
no , i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries .
that was a good day

they 're towing your car , they 're towing your car
i 'm parked in a garage on morton
they 're towing a car . and i am seeing spots .
oh my god ross you don 't have emma and rachel you don 't have emma where 's emma ? who has emma ?
joey relax my mother picked her up two hours ago . you were there
i was ?
yes and you talked to her
i did ?
she dropped off a casserole ?
oh yeah the casserole lady .
so , did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?
yeah , uh and then i figured after you win , we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it

don 't touch the phone i 'll get it , i 'll get it , i 'll get it
think he washed his hands ?
hello ? hey charlie , what do you know ?
what 's going on ?
chandler is supposed to find out if he 's getting an assistent job at his ad agency . but out of the 15 interns , they are only hiring three .
ooh tough odds
yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery
look who 's coming around
damnit . alright call me when you know more .
did you get it ?
one of the slots got filled .
by you ?
sense the tone no that kid nate got it .
oh i hate that guy i mean come on kid pull up your pants
yeah i know .
well , there 's two spots left right ?
yeah i mean i want this so much i mean , i wanna get one , i want my friend charlie to get one except i don 't care about charlie .

hey you guys ok , you 're not going to believe this i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight
hey that reminds me , i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work .
a psychic and a wishbone ? guys give someone else a chance
alright , who wants to do it ?
oh can i ? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone . it 's really not fair either you know , just because we don 't eat the meat doesn 't mean we don 't like to play with the carcasses
ok , hey rach ?
oh no , i 'm good , i don 't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands .
i 'll do it it 'll get the casserole stink off of mine .

i hope i win
well , it doesn 't really matter you 're both wishing for the same thing , right ?
i can 't tell you what i 'm wishing for else you know won 't come true
right but we know what you 're wishing for
can 't really say
i understand , but you 're wishing for what we think you 're wishing for , aren 't you ?
i 'm not really comfortable with these questions
please , just do it
one , two , three

i won , hey
you know what , i 'm sure your wish is gonna come true , but , you guys just in case , maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp ah that thing gets hot
you know , ross , just keep making your jokes . how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?
uh , you 're not gonna win .
oh , i know , i know , the odds are against us , but somebody has to win , and it could be us and then how you gonna feel ? you know , we 're gonna be all like oh everybody , let 's take our helicopters up to the cape and you 're gonna be all like
ok , i 've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .
i can see the headline now lottery winners friend filled with regret eats own arm .
why would i eat my own arm ?
well you wouldn 't , but we own the paper , we can print whatever we want .
you know what , ross ? i 'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .
why ?
because i know that you think the lottery is boohaki but we 're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun . and you 're my brother , and i want you to be a part of this .
you don 't have to do that , i 'll pay for myself . but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys that 's so sweet come here
get a room
ok , so now that you 're in , what are you gonna do if we win ?
i don 't know , probably just invest it .
ooh calm down
seriously , that 's your fantasy ? to invest it ?
oh , i 'm sorry , did i say invest it ? i meant be cool and piss it all away
ooh , ooh , i know we should pool all own money and buy the knicks
i don 't really care about the knicks .
oh , you will when i pick you as starting forward .
you would do that ? i never get picked
you know , i 'm not sure a sports team is the way to go .
you 're not gonna let me buy the knicks ? ? i can 't believe you 're taking this away from me
you 're right , it has been you dream for over 15 seconds .
uh , how long until they announce the numbers , mommy ?

i 'll take this one too uh mommy ?
oh , i 've gotten into the habit of calling rachel mommy when we 're around emma . which i now realize we are not
i 'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .
although if we 're gonna do that , we should probably call me daddy too .
oooh , i like that , daddy
i i was just talking about rachel .
oooh , is daddy getting angry ? is daddy gonna spank me ?
well that depends have you been a baaad gi no i can 't .

hello ? hello ? oh , hey charlie . did anybody else hear ? what ? susan got it ? ? how ? oh man , i would have slept with him alright , bye .
dude , i 'm sorry . but hey , there 's one spot left , right ?
well no , charlie 's gonna get that .
hey , don 't say that you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job
he 's the boss 's son .
come on , lottery
ooh , you guys , it starts in like 20 minutes .
ok , here we go . we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we 've won . so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this ? ok , how about this we divide them into 6 groups of 40 , and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their
ooh , i have another idea
i 'm sorry , idea time is over .
ok , well , are all the tickets in the bowl ?
yeah .
what about the ones you have on the nightstand ?
there are no tickets on the nightstand
yes there are , i just saw them a few minutes ago .

un , no you didn 't you must be mistaken
honey , there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand
chandler , sense the tone

well , well , well , look what mommy found

ok , fine i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .
uh the psychic also said that i would be betrayed .
i can 't believe this , i thought we were all in this together
hey , you just got in 5 minutes ago
3 minutes ago i don 't know why that 's important
i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut , when did you even get those ?
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic
i 'll show you how .
ok , well monica , suppose one of your special tickets win ? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends ?
please if i win the lottery , you guys are not gonna leave me . someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn 't get rid of you for 3 days
chandler , would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?
she 's right , you shouldn 't have bought tickets just for us
ahhh
let me finish however , it doesn 't look like i 'm gonna get this job so i can 't afford to have principles , so screw you , the tickets are ours
there 's the man i married
all right , believe me.if you win the lottery , it 's the last you 're gonna hear from us
fine don 't be my friends i 'll buy new friends yeah , and then i 'll pay for their plastic surgery so they 'd look just like you
oh alright , you know what ? that 's it i want my share of the tickets
yeah , i want my tickets too and i 'm buying the knicks and steffi graff , ah ah
than i want mine , too and if i win i 'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond .
oh , you guys we 've got to keep all the tickets together
no , no we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them
hey , if anybody gets extra tickets , it should be me this all thing was my idea

dude , don 't worry bout it i know how we can make your money back this is a nice hotel , you know , plenty of amenities , we just load up on those like those apples . instead of taking one , i 'm i take six
great , at a hundred dollars an apple , we 're there

i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant .
oh , that 's not cool .
dude , none of this is cool .
no , chandler , you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you . for example hair drier , no , no , no , but shampoo and conditioners , yes , yes , yes . now , the salt shaker is off-limits , but the salt i wish i 'd thought this through
i think i know what you mean though the lamp is the hotel 's , but the bulbs oh , you already got that .

no , no , no , you can 't take the remote control
yes , but the batteries

thank you , thank you very much
let 's celebrate with some maple candy
no
at least tell me where you hid it .

can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams ?
let me think . oh , when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese , and on our wedding night i ate his head .
ok , well this is like that in no way . i had a i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .
wow , do you mean like kiss him-kiss him ?
oh yeah i mean , that was pretty intense .
what do you think brought than on ?
i don 't know i mean , maybe that 's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .
a love scene ? with who ?
olivia .
olivia ? i thought she was marrying connor oh right , real life more important .
so do you think that my dream means anything ?
i don 't know . i mean , you saw him do a love scene , so maybe you don 't have a thing for joey , maybe you have a thing for drake .
ah well it was joey reading drake 's lines in the dream
of course it was trust me , when it comes to psychology i know what i 'm talking about . i took two psych classes in college .
you took the same class twice .
it was hard

hey
hi .
here , monica , look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh , huh wait right ? i mean , this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man .
oh phoebe ? maybe i wasn 't clear before . i really love listening to your music here , but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .
right , yeah , ok , i 'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .
phoebe , it 's not what you wear . it 's sort of your songs i just don 't think you should play at the restaurant anymore .
oh , ok . fine , i 'll just , i 'll take the hat back .

hey , so you guys , the funniest thing happened , at work
my songs aren 't good enough for your restaurant ?
ok , we 're still on that .
i didn 't say your songs were not good enough .
then what 's wrong with them ? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?
tiny portions ?
yeah well , excuse me , i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer , but i can 't see it , i can 't see it
phoebe , it 's not about quantity .
well it 's not about quality .
oh really , you want to talk about quality ? have you heard of a key ? it 's what some people sing in .
well at least all my songs don 't taste like garlic . yeah , there are other ingredients monica .
ok , so that 's what we 're doing . you know , when i 'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs , i 'm wearing ear plugs .
ear plugs , or cloves of garlic ?
you know what ? i take back what i said before . you keep playing at the restaurant , because with your music driving people inside , my bar sales are going up like crazy .
what are people having , the garlic martini ?

here 's your copy of the bill , we hope you enjoyed your stay .
oh we did , and you still have all your lamps .

oh , i didn 't factor in the room tax .
oh dude , don 't worry about it , i found an unattended maid 's car . we 're way ahead of the game .

oh my god .
what ?
there 's something new in the bowl .
look , we have enough , just walk away .
no , but i want i want the pinecones
there 's a forest right outside .
it 's not the same .
ok , go quick

thank you for a delightful stay .

oh , my maple candy

food here at javu will kill you the food here at javu will kill you

thank god , it 's just you i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .
you 'd better get back in that kitchen monica , the garlic is not gonna overuse itself .
ok , you have to stop playing now .
why ? the only person my playing is bothering is you
oh yeah ? ok , let 's settle this , come on
get your garlic-peelers off me
excuse me , excuse me , hi , i 'm monica geller i 'm the head chef here ok , i was actually expecting a little applause there , but whatever ok , quick question by a show of hands , how many of you were bothered by this woman 's singing outside ?
ok , ok , how many of you enjoyed the music outside ? ha
alright , let me ask you this question how many of you thought the music was fine , but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ? .
ok , well , who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?
ok , well , alright , who thinks the food is fine , the music was fine , but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ? .
excuse us alright here 's a question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?
oh who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend 's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great
i 'm sorry
i 'm sorry too
ooohh hey wanna stick around and i 'll whip you up some dinner ?
yeah as long as it 's free food here is ridiculously over-p

who 's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won 't hate me ?

hey
hey
joey , do you have peanut butter on the back of your head ?
oh man i thought i got it all
how how ?
i was making a peanut butter smoothy , right ?
uh-huh
and i couldn 't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender and i thought well how important can that be , right ? turns out very
wow definitely just drake
what ?
what how is it going with drake ?
oh i don 't think it 's going very well
what that scene i saw was so good
well , i 'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow
joey , is this that thing that you do when you say you 're bad so i 'll give you a compliment ?
a little . yeah no , i really am worried , you know , i mean i have to make it convincing that i 'm in love with olivia .
so ?
so i 've never played that
ooh honey , it can 't be that hard , i mean , you 've been in love before ?
uh well just once with you
ok this could be a little awkward i 'm just going to blow past it well can 't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance ?
what the hell are you talking about ? ?
alright , alright look , just uh just try to remember how you felt when you were in love , and think about that when you 're playing the scene .
oh ok , yeah , i think i can do that . yeah ok , there 's this party scene coming up and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can 't and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab
joey , you never you never talked about that before
well hey , you know what else i could use ? there 's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia 's bedroom , and she doesn 't know he 's there which never happened with us and he knows he shouldn 't be there , but he just wants to look at her you know ? and i remember all

thanks dude this is great

i got you something from vermont

please chandler is the love of my life oooh leather pants have mercy

so , eh it 's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston , huh ?
actually , i 'm kinda happy to be leaving i just broke up with someeone .
ooh so sad still , it can 't be easy for you to leave harvard ? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer ?
actually , alby is the guy i broke up with .
you you dated albert wintermeyer ?
yeah
and you called him alby ? i mean that 's like like calling albert einstein er alby
yeah , well , he is a brilliant man .
eh , you think ? i mean , you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10
yes and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend , he had a lot of issues
oh like what ? oh i 'm sorry , i don 't mean to pry it 's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch access hollywood .
ok , you want the dirt ? alby was seriously insecure . i mean , he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him .
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize ?
a guy who won two .
two ? wha ? don 't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
yeah for three years .
oh my god have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn 't won the nobel prize ?
no bu but there was my first boyfriend billy .
oh yeah ? no , no nobel prizes for him ?
no , but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant .
huh huh what a loser some more wine ?
hey ross
how is it going with charlie ?
oh great after i finish my wine i 'm going to blow my eh. average-sized brains out .
oh , what 's the matter ?
she she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners . oh my god , at the chinese restaurant earlier today , i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth .
i always loved that
of course you would , your brains are smaller than mine man , i can 't compete with the guys she goes out with , they are so out of my league oh my god
worse ?
oh much , much worse . i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians can we walk ? oh , you you like that ?
no .
what ?
come on i think this is funny

well , i bet you are all thinkin now would be a really great time for an intermission , huh ?
oh yes , god yes
well , you 're not gonna get one because in life there are no intermissions , people . chapter 7 divorce is a 4 letter word . how could he leave me ? ?
i i don 't know you seem lovely .

hey ross , this is one of my co-stars , dirk . dirk , this is my good friend ross .

it 's a science .
oh hey well listen , i play a scientist on days . and my character has just won the nobel prize .

hey ross , listen , dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together , or
oh , well no , but i mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys .
hey , i got a 690 on my sats .
i 'd lead with that .

that 's it , just sign right on the bra .
monica
don 't worry joe , i won 't come next year

what have you got there ?
just some boys gave me their phone numbers .
ah , let me see damn , that 's a lot of guys are you a little slutty ?
i think i am .
let me see if i approve any of these clowns . this guy wears a rug . this guy 's canadian . and this guy is in a cult , ok , and it costs you 5,000 $ to get to level three and i don 't feel any different .

pass , pass , oh , pass , double-pass , pass
why , why , what 's wrong with these guys ?
nothing major , it 's just that , you know , they 're not really good enough for you , and you deserve the best .
joey , you 're so sweet .
that 's true . but you know what , it doesn 't matter because i already know who you 're gonna go home with tonight .
who ?

me .
what ? really ?
yes , cause we live together , that 's a joke
oh screw it , i didn 't get it
gotcha .
oh , very funny joey .

so , how did you enjoy the play ?
oh my god , honey , i 'm so so so so so sorry .
well you should be . you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .
you really liked it ?
oh yeah i mean at first i hated it , but why wouldn 't i , because as a man i 've been trained not to listen but after chapter 16 fat , single and ready to mingle , i was uplifted .
oh really
oh yeah , i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman tell me , tell me about your first period
no
did somebody sign your bra ?
so i got it when i was 13

hey ross so listen , about you and the dinosaur girl , are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ? what is that , come on , a piece of paper ?
it 's actually a 1,000,000 $ prize .
go charlie but my point is , ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them . maybe she 's looking to , you know , slum it with some average joe phd .
yeah , maybe . i do have my whole career in front of me . i mean , i can still win a nobel prize . although the last two papers i 've written were widely discredited .
you 're so much more than just brains you 're sweet , and kind , and funny
and sexy .
ok well give her a chance to see all of that
yeah , you 're right , thanks pheebs , i 'm gonna go find her .
good for you and hey , i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch
stop going through my stuff

hey
hey
i just wanted to let you know i 've changed my mind i 'm gonna do it , i 'm gonna kiss joey .
no , you can 't friends hooking up is a bad idea .
please , what about you and chandler ?
that 's different i was drunk and stupid
well hello
what about all the guys that you 've got the phone numbers from ? why don 't you just kiss one of them ?
i could , i could but i don 't want to i want to kiss joey
alright . i think it 's a big mistake but it 's your decision .
i 'm gonna do it .
and i can 't stop you .
no .

hey rach , have you seen charlie anywhere ?

i 'm smarter than him

hey , thank you so much for these tickets , chandler .
oh well , this was a really important experience for me , and i wanted to share it with you .
oh , you 're so wonderful .
why don 't you like me chapter one my first period .
can 't believe you guys bought that , enjoy your slow death .

hey i 'm all packed and ready to go
oh , that 's right daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today . we 're going to a conference in barbados , right ?
mmh-mmh .
can you say barbados ?
barbados
ok , i gotta say . i mean , it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech uh and i 've a surprise , uh i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference that 's right
do you have anything that would get us out of them ?
yeah ross , i mean we 're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we 're gonna wanna do , you know , island 's stuff .
i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .
oh , right , because he 's a scientist
no , no , because , you know , he 's been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight , he 'll die .
ok , we gotta go , yeah ? so , we 'll see you guys tomorrow .
all right , let 's do it 5 hour flight with charlie , have a couple of drinks , get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .
it 's a blanket joe , not a cloak of invisibility

wow this place is beautiful
look at all these paleontologists
i know , there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow
oh my god , i can 't believe you 're here
i think i 've been recognized , this happens all the time
doctor geller , i 'm such a huge fan
that never happens
i 've been following your career for years , i-i can 't wait for your keynote speech .
wow this is very flattering , uh
i would love your autograph .
uh , uh sure uhm dear
sarah .
sarah . i dig you , uh ? doctor ross geller .
thank you so much
yeah , oh and sarah i 'd like to introduce you to my colleague , uh , professor wheeler , a-and this is joey tribbiani .
are you a paleontologist ?
no , god , no no no no , i 'm an actor . you 'd probably recognize me from a little show called the days of our lives .
dude , it 's just days of our lives there 's no the .
ok , ross it 's it 's fun , yeah no , i-i play doctor drake ramoray .
i 'm sorry , i don 't own a tv .
you don 't own a tv ? what 's all your furniture pointed at ? ?

david , can you help me ? i 'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air .
oh , certainly . that 's a combination of bernoulli 's principle and newton 's third law of motion .
see ?
yeah , that 's the same as it has something to do with wind .
alright , i 'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .
oh , i should go , too . oh , now tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there .

mike ? ? who 's mike ?
mike is your ex uh boyfriend
that 's right oh , yeah well , i 've totally forgotten about im ah that 's-that 's a blast from the past
it 's ok . ho-honest mistake .
really , it doesn 't mean anything . i mean , you know , monica refers to chandler as richard all the time
she does ?
let 's get you out of here

at least you took me down with you
i 'm sooo sorry i just i keep thinking about mike i 'm crazy about david , and we 're having so much fun together . why-why do i miss mike ? that 's-that 's gonna go away , right ?
i guess , in time .
yeah .
i mean , my feelings for richard are certainly gone .
you just did it again . chandler , your feelings for chandler are certainly gone

well , phoebe 's still pretty hung up on that mike , uh ?
i wouldn 't read too much into it .
still you know , a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend 's name , that-that 's not a good thing , right ?
david , let me stop you there cause i think i see where this is going . i 'm not very good at giving advice . so if you want advice , go to ross , monica , or joey , if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .
sorry , i just i wish there was something i could do , you know ? well , you know phoebe
seriously , we 're gonna do this ?
i 'm sorry , uh i just wish i could make her forget about mike already , you know why did phoebe and mike break up ?
oh , because his penis was too big . oh , i 'm sorry , that 's the kind of thing i do . they broke up because mike didn 't want to get married . hey , what if you just let phoebe know you 'd be open to marriage ?
that 's great that 's great i-i 'll propose to her
what ?
well , i was probably going to do it at some point .
i didn 't mean now
why not ? it 's brilliant goodbye mike , we 'll see you at the wedding , fella well , we probably won 't invite you to the wedding thank you , chandler . sincerely .
well , you 're welcome glad i could help .
how do you think i should propose ?
david , i 'm pretending to read here

yeah how you doin ? yeah alright

hey , hey you said you 're gonna wear a thong , where 's the thong ?
i didn 't mean a thong i meant thong s
you really should have been more clear about that

hey
hey
you 're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs
oh ah eh britney spears ?
yeah , she never misses these conferences no , i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz
oh my god did you talk to him ?
yeah what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?
you could say hey kenny , how come you 're not britney spears ?
ready to go ?
yeah
wha ? you 're gonna go now ? i thought we could hang out ?
oh i can 't i have seminars all day and i promised ross i would look at his speech .
yeah .
but maybe we can have dinner later ? on the balcony ? will be romantic .
will you wear a thong ?
i will if you will .
oh you got yourself a very weird deal
i 'm good , i have dinner plans .
so you 'll be ok ?
yeah , yeah . i 've got tons of stuff i could do . i 'm gonna hit the beach , go swimming
uh , joe , have you looked outside ?
no , why ?

oh man
there 's an indoor pool , you can swim there
i wasn 't gonna swim , i was gonna dig a hole

wow that mike thing was interesting i don 't know what 's gonna happen with phoebe and david .
i do want a hint ? huh ? i do i do .
ok , i 'm sensing that this is some kind of word play , because you are pink with barely controlled glee .
david is going to propose to phoebe .
what ? why ?
be-cause , we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .
chandler , we have talked about this . you are not supposed to give people advice now couldn 't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?
i did a penis one look , just so i know , what was so wrong about what i said ?
they 've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike she 'll say no , david 's heart will be broken , it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .
man , that 's some bad advice

oh hey thank god you guys are here
hey hey what 's going on ?
everything is upside down here it rains all day long , nobody watches tv and ross is famous

alright , i don 't wanna alarm anybody , but monica 's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed

ok when i go places with high humidity , it gets a little extra body , ok ?
that 's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross
come on , i 'll show you guys where to check in
oh , honey , can you make sure we get a king size bed
oh david , get one for us too oh , oh , and see if they have a heart-shaped one and with mirrors on the ceiling
and make sure our room isn 't next to theirs .
ooh you guys are so lucky you are here with people , you known it 's such a romantic place . that 's all , i just wish i could share that with a guy .
not joey .
not joey , no , i was just lusting after chandler .
yeah , right

so , ehm i 'm proposing to pheobe tonight .
tonight ? isn 't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ? oh , there it is
yeah , well , being a failed scientist doesn 't pay quite as well as you might think . that 's uhm one seventieth of a karat . and the clarity is uhm is quite poor .
nice
monica , can i talk to you for a sec ?
ok
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight
see what happens when you give people advice ? i hope you told him not to ?
that would be advice
ok fine . i 'll handle this . phoebe ?
yeah ?
i need to talk to you .
are you leaving the supremes ?
ok , my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice . look , david is going to propose to you tonight .
wow ? really ? that 's fantastic
what are you serious ? you wanna marry him ? wha what about mike ?
oh , ok , you want me to marry mike ? alright , well , let 's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle . i can just see it mike , do you take phoebe you know , it 's every girl 's dream
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?
sure look , ok , bottom line i love mike david david . i love david . don 't look at me that way , roseanne rosannadanna

by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way , bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .
it 's great . you 're gonna be the hit of the conference .
oh and you know what , it will be even better tomorrow , because i won 't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet . .
hey guys
the chocolates aren 't here yet .
damnit
ross just read me his speech . it 's fantastic
oh , is it on the computer , cuz i 'd love to give it a read ?
if you want to check your email , just ask
what ? may i ?
what 's with the rain , geller ? i mean , when i signed up for dino week , nobody said anything about it being monsoon season .
actually the wet season is june to december .
it 's not the time charlie .
oh , no , no , no dear god , no
oh what , did someone outbid you for the teapot ? oh secret teapot ?
your computer , i don 't know wha everything 's gone
wha what do you mean ?
it must be a virus . i think it erased your hard drive .
what , oh my god . what did you do ?
someone i don 't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it .
why , why would you open it ?
well , it didn 't say this is a virus
what did it say ?
nude pictures of anna kournikova . i 'm so sorry .
what what am i gonna do ? my speech is gone , chandler
it 's not gone i mean , i 'm sure you printed out a copy . you have a hard copy , right ?
no i don 't
well , you must be pretty mad at yourself right now

it 's really gone ?
yep i 'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career
i just feel awful .
yeah , well you should i mean , nude pictures of anna kournikova ? i mean , she 's never even won a major tournament
well , i tried billy jean king , but you know , you and monica have the same i 'm gonna kill you look ? i can usually make it go away by kissing her
get out
you know , this happens all the time to my computer at work .
well , what do you do ?
well , i usually go play tetris on somebody else 's computer .
i can 't believe this . i can 't believe this is happening . i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow ok ? i have to stand up in front of all these people . what am i gonna say ?
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions .
i don 't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now , joe
ross , we can solve this . i just heard your speech . we can recreate it we 've got all night
wha what you really think we can do that ?
oh wait , joey and i are supposed to have dinner .
hey don 't worry about that i mean , ross needs you and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can .
ugh .
alright , ok , let 's do it . uhm , i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating uhm , and then , then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era , the breakup of pangea , hello and then , there 's the eh there 's the overview
oh , oh any chance any of this happened in a galaxy far , far away ? .

hello ?
ok , mike , enough is enough , now you love phoebe and she loves you , so you need to get over your whole i never want to get married thing and step up
who is this ?
this is monica i 'm phoebe 's friend . listen , phoebe is back with david and he 's going to propose to her , and she is going to say yes but i know she really wants to be with you
he he 's gonna propose ?
i i 'm sorry , did you say something ? i can 't hear through all this damned hair
look , if phoebe wants to marry david , she should , i 'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you .
you don 't tell me what to do i tell you what to do just call her . she 's at the paradise hotel in barbados . and while i 've got you , you 've got curly hair . what do you do in humidity ? damnit

well , i hope you 're happy
oooh i hope you 're happy too , honey
phoebe is going to say yes to david . see , that 's what happens when you meddle in people 's lives
phoebe is going to say yes ? that 's , that 's great
no it 's not , b 'cause she 's still in love with mike
and there 's not chance that will work ?
no , i called him . it 's not gonna happen .
oooooooh meddler meddler
well , if you hadn 't meddled to start with , i wouldn 't have had to go in there and meddle myself . now , no matter how much we meddle , we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up in the first place

oh my god , he 's gonna do it now . please , i cannot watch this , let 's go .
i think we have some time . have you ever heard him talk ? uh , phoebe , uh , i would be honoured , uh spit it out , david
uh , phoebe , uh you 're an amazing woman , and the time we spent apart was , was unbearable . of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn 't help

oh my god , mike
it 's david , actually

ok , would you care for my seat as well ?
actually yeah , that 'll be great .
that 's fair , you 've had a long trip .
phoebe , i love you . i mean , i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason , but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you .
kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say .
sorry david , but she really has to know this .
alright , but after this i want to see you outside . if the rain stops .
you 're the most incredible woman i 've ever met . how can i lose you ? now , i don 't actually have a ring

phoebe , will you marry me ?
no
uhm ha ha
i love you . but i never needed a proposal from you . i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere , you know , that we had a future .
we can have any future you want .

ok , i 'm gonna take off .
david , i 'm so sorry , i 'm sorry .
just so i know , if i had asked first
yeah , i might have said yes , but that would have been wrong .
please , you don 't have to explain . i mean , perhaps if i hadn 't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us . and i wouldn 't have ruined my career , or lost that toe to frostbite . it was a good trip
is it ok if i hug you now ?
yes
because of our meddling alright ?

oh , ain 't this nice ? it 's so quiet , i could just lie here all day .
i know

open your drapes open your drapes
i 'm so glad we 've got adjoining rooms

the sun is out
hey remember when i had corneas ?
ok listen , you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs , and i 'll get the magazines and the lotion .
ladies ? ross 's speech is in 45 minutes .
nooo
damn it
walls are pretty thin , guys

then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan so leathery and wrinkled , i 'm so jealous
finally , factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus , argentinasaurus
not to mention the cold sores .

and that 's just the herbivores . i 'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores , their heads are already too big . which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .

really ?
but all kidding aside , in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus

what ?
he said erectus
you 're you 're kidding , right ?
no , he really said it .
and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus

erectus ?
homo .

in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century . thank you

oh , thanks guys
i thought it was wonderful
oh
jarvis oberblau , cornell . i mean , the ideas you put forth and , and from someone so young and .
ok now now we 're just holding hands

they have a game room downstairs ping pong and stuff .
ping pong ? honey , they have ping pong let 's play

c 'mon mike , you can beat her knock that dog off her head

oh , damn it
i sleep with him
game , point
don 't get too cocky remember i won the last one oh , by the way , how did that feel , losing to a girl ?
you know , you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that .

no , no , nooo
and that 's how it 's done
okay-dokay , you 've each won a game and i 've lost what 's felt like a year of my life . so everybody goes home a winner .
best out of three ?
that 's what i 'm thinking .
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?
serve the ball , chump
serve the ball , chump .
ok mike , better come back mike , better come back .

i 'm just saying , i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city , well , that 'd be just nifty

jarvis ?
oh , you 're back this is my wife , nancy .
get out

ross , can i talk to you for a minute ?
yes , please so , what 's going on ?
uh , well joey and i broke up .
oh my god , wh-what happened ?
joey is a great guy , but we 're just so different i mean , during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus
i knew that was him
anyway i just , uh , i think it 's for the best .
hey , you ok ?
i guess . there was hum there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey . i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else .

ok geller . last day of the conference , you know what happens to the keynote speaker .
oh , professor clerk we 're kind of in the middle of a conversation , here .
yeah , can you guys just throw him in the pool later ?
or we could throw you both in now
ok , gentlemen please aren 't we a little old for this ? i mean , we 're scientists , right ? we 're academics . and most importantly i you-you will have to catch us first . . go , go , go

ok , so it 's a tie again , 41 to 41 .
ok , look enough is enough
no , i have just to have two more points to beat him
monica , that was also true an hour ago i mean , please , look at you your hand is blistered , you can barely stand , your hair is inexplicable ok , you 've already proven you are just as good as he is , now we 've missed our dinner reservations , so now let 's just go
i can 't just walk away i 've put in four hours
but
look you knew this about me when you married me you agreed to take me in sickness and in health . well , this is my sickness
what about the obsessive cleaning ?
that 's just good sense

oh , that 's ok . i don 't care which of them i beat .
ok , we 're taking that paddle home , mister .
honey , you don 't have to do this .
yes , i do . now , i may not understand why you have to win so badly , but if it 's important to you then it 's important to me , because i love you .
but you suck
you 're welcome , sweetheart .

all right mike , let 's get this over with . sudden death . whoever wins this point , wins .
ok

oh my god you 're good

that 's why

thanks
hi .
are they still looking for us ?
yeah . the bartender said that they split up into two search parties , the herbivores and the carnivores . you know , we as a group are not the coolest .

i don 't think they saw us .
i don 't think they did .

hum , so , i started to say you something earlier , hum there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey . i kind of realized i was starting to have feelings for someone else .
oh . can i can i ask who ?
i think you know .
i think i know too but i 've been really wrong about this stuff in the past , so

i 'm sorry we we can 't .
all right , all right .

what ?

oh , the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you wanna ?
you know , i 'd love to , but i 'm a little tired .
i 'll put a pillowcase over my head .
you 're on

hey
what 's up ?
well , okay , mike 's taking a shower , which by the way there 's no law against . and then we 're gonna grab some food , so if you want

finally
is that ross ?
yeah , you can hear everything through these stupid walls .
sounds like he 's with someone .
he could be alone . this morning i heard him do push-ups , and then talk to his triceps .
wait a minute , i think phoebe 's right . you know i hear someone else in there with him .

ooh dr. geller
god , you 're amazing i didn 't even have to ask you to call me that .
oh my god , that 's charlie
she 's cheating on joey with ross
oh that tart floozy giant
i 'm not sure about this .
yeah , you 're right . this is none of our business .
no i 'm not sure that it 's the best way to hear everything . someone get me a glass

what ? ross and charlie ? wow she 's really making her way through the group , huh ? ah , who am i to talk ?

i can 't believe this . rachel and joey ?
how about the dinosaur twins in the other room ? no-one is manning that wall

i think i hear curtains closing
we 've got shoes being kicked off over here .
bedsprings , unmistakable
you do realise that 's your brother ?
not until you said it . somebody switch wait a minute ross and charlie , joey and rachel , phoebe and mike we 're the only people leaving with the same person we came with .

okay , i 've had it with the hair jokes . tomorrow morning , before we leave , i 'm going to the salon .
okay buckwheat
you gotta hear this , it 's great it 's like free porn

weh sigh
uhm is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just i don 't think i can do this
ooh is it because of what might be on the bedspread , because i saw that news report too , with the infra red and the i could just
no , no look , i need to talk to joey . i mean , you guys just broke up . before anything more happens between us , i need to know he 's okay with it .

other wall , people other wall

rach , you there ?
oh my god , it 's ross . what are we gonna do ?

hi
you know where joey is ?
i really don 't
can i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah , sure

i don 't believe this have you guys been
shhh this is the listening side of the wall .

and then she told me that she and joey had broken up , and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me .
uh-huh right yeah
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .
oh , i know i know it 's been really hard for you .
anyway , one thing lead to another , and oh before you know it , we were kissing . i mean , how angry do you think joey is gonna be ?
that is hard to say , ross . that is hard to say .
you know , i gotta go find him . he 's gotta be here someplace .
you would think

joey
is he gone ?
how are you doing this ?

pssst
how wha hey what are you what is this ? have you guys been listening this entire time ?
ye-ah
now , what is this ?
ah , what is this ? well , lets see , we kissed for ten minutes and now we 're talking to our friends about it , so i guess this is sixth grade
oh no have you thought about it how complicated this could get ? what about ross ?
well , he 's with charlie now .
yeah , but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her . and as his friend , i mean , don 't you think he deserves the same from you ?
you 're a pain in my ass , geller
all right , look you guys look , we appreciate all the advice , but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it
okay , well we 'll go back in there , but will you do one thing for us ? the people that care about you ?
sure
enunciate
get out

are they right ?
probably , yeah i mean , maybe we should hold off until we talk to ross .
yeah yeah , we can wait , we don 't have to do anything tonight .
yeah , i think that 'd be best so , so i 'm gonna i 'm gonna take off
although
i like although
i mean , you know ross and i haven 't dated in like six years
six years ? wow it 's almost as long as highschool
plus , you know , he is with charlie now .
absolutely he 's not thinking about you .
no
i 'm thinking about you
yeah
let 's forget about ross

what d 'ya know it 's a treat for the eyes and the ears .

whoo , whoo . wow , it 's uhm kinda weird that i 'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up .
yeah , it 's almost if air barbados doesn 't care about your social life .
look , does someone mind switching to sit with charlie ?
oh , i uh , i mean , i dude , i spent the whole conference with charlie .
i understand
no , i 'll do it .
wish i could switch with someone . i really don 't wanna sit with allen iverson over there .

uhm you know , once we 're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign you feel free to roam about my cabin
you should be careful when checking your overhead bins , cause items may shift during
aaah you 're not good at this
you don 't have to go home tonight , do you ?

i 'll tell her that it 's over tonight at dinner . i promise .
oh , okay good . you do that . and then when you get home , maybe there 'll be a special delivery package waiting for you .
maybe i 'll sign for it . tear it open . pull out the packing material
you know what , we 're gonna have sex . let 's just leave it there .

right , i 'm gonna go talk to joey . i think this is the right time . he 's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free .
okay good luck .

ross is coming over . i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .

did i ? let 's refresh . i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .
fine , so you don 't like them . everybody else does .
again , let 's journey back as i recall what rachel said , was she had never notice the shape of your skull before . and joey well , joey didn 't realise that there was anything different .

oh , why would he do this ? i mean , what 's wrong with me ?
nothing , there 's nothing wrong with you .
i mean , what the hell am i supposed to do now ?
damn it woman , pull yourself together have some pride , for the love of god .

okay , not a fan of the tough love .
i just can 't believe that mike didn 't give me any warning .
but he didn 't really know , you know . he wasn 't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me
he proposed to you ? this is the worst birthday ever .
look , precious mike 's not worth this . you 're an attractive , intelligent woman and let 's face it , mike 's kind of a wang . i mean , he proposed to me while he was still seeing you he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday ? and , i don 't like to kiss-and-tell
oh , my god , maybe you 're right . maybe i don 't need him . i deserve to be treated with respect .

screw you , mike . you 're a coward and a bastard , and i hope you rot in hell .

you 're welcome

honey , you 've been in there for a long time is everything okay ?
not really .

i have a problem .
really ? what happened ?
well , i was dancing around , and singing no woman , no cry and i got stuck .
you can 't move at all ?
oh , well , i can move
if i untangle you , will you please get rid of the corn rose ?
i guess so
some of these look a little frayed .
yeah , i tried to gnaw myself free .

hey
hi
so , did you err did you tell ross ?
well , i tried , but then he had a shampoo related emergency . so i guess now it 's your turn again .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no i think it 's better if you tell him , you know . it 's easier for a woman . that way , you know , if he gets mad , all you have to do is go i didn 't mean it . i
yeah , cause that 's what we do .
alright , alright , okay , uhm how bout this , how about this ? tomorrow tomorrow we 'll both go and we 'll tell him together .
okay , that sounds fair . it just means that once again we can 't
i know , i know , but that 's okay . i mean , we can control ourselves , we 're not animals .
no of course we can wait . alright , so i guess that means good night then ?
yeah good night
goo--ood night
good night
seriously , good night
stop saying good night .
okay .

look what i found in the drawer and you said i 'd never wear this
now that i untangled you , how bout you doing a little something for me ?
sure , what do you have in mind ?
i think you know .
really ? i don 't really feel like it .
this is what i want to do .
okay , i just don 't get why you like it so much .
she 's an fbi agent , posing as a beauty contestant .

okay , ross , i realise that you didn 't expect to walk in and see that , but let me explain , okay ?
we weren 't doing anything
rach , he just saw us .
shhh .
but what you saw , that is the extent of it , okay ? one kiss .
no , come on , that is a lie . we also kissed in barbados .
dude , chill okay , we also kissed in barbados , but we didn 't plan it , okay ? and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie .
yeah , you started it i 've got to chill .
look , we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened , but
we feel so terrible about this , ross .
yeah , but it did happen , so

ross ?
ross ? can we just close the door ?

ross , say something . anything .
so you two are ?
yeah .
and have you ed ?
no , no , no
no , no , no
but if i hadn 't walked in here , would you ?
probably .

no , no
ross , this is not how we wanted you to find out about this . you have every right to go nuts .
i 'm not going nuts . do you see me go nuts ?
no , but you know what i mean .
hey , hey , hey if you two are happy , then i 'm happy for you . i 'm fine
really ?
absolutely . i 'm fine totally fine . i don 't know why it 's coming out all loud and squeaky , cause really , i 'm fine . i 'm not saying i wasn 't a little surprised to see you guys kissing . i mean , at first i was like but now that i 've had time
ross
it 's all working out me charlie , and you two . you know what we should do ?
calm ourselves ?
no . we should all have dinner . yes , we 'll do it tomorrow night . i 'll cook
look , don 't you think that will be a little weird ?
weird ? what ? what 's weird ? the only thing weird would be if someone didn 't like mexican food , because i 'm making fajitas
i do like fajitas .

god , this adoption stuff is so overwhelming . there 's inter-country adoption , dependency adoption there are so many ways to go , and this is like the biggest decision of our lives .
there 's a hair in my coffee .

hey guys
hey .
hey , have you seen frank jr . , cause he 's meeting me here with the triplets .
you know , it 's funny . every time you say triplets , i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds .

that 's sweet . drink your hair .
hey , what 's all this stuff ?
oh , they 're brochures from different adoption agencies .
ooh , babies oh , this one is so cute , get this one
that 's not really how it works .
oh , how does it work ?
i don 't know
well , if you 're having a hard time , you should talk to my friends , bill and colleen . they adopted a kid . i 'm sure they 'd help you .
thanks , that would be great . hey , honey , wouldn 't that be great ?

alright , alright , alright . remember what we talked about . when we 're in a public place , there are certain rules .

that 's not what we talked about
hey
hey .
good to see you .
good to see you , too .
hi frank .
hi , how you doin ?
oh , my goodness , they 've all gotten so big

which one is which again ?
oh , that 's frank jr . jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady 's purse . and that 's chandler climbing on chandler , and that 's leslie throwing bagels at him .
willing to adopt triplets ? no

ah , can i just say i know we 're doing this for ross , and that 's cool , but if it was up to me , this is not what we 'd be doing on our first date .
well , what would we be doing ?
i 'd take you out for a romantic night . some champagne , fancy dinner , feel you up on the carriage ride home
feel me up ?
in a carriage

hey , charlie
hey .
hi , hi . so dreading this ?
oh , you bet .

so , did you bring a little something for ross ?
actually it 's stuff you left at my apartment .
oh . oh , thanks .
and you know , you can just give me my stuff whenever you want .
yeah , i didn 't throw any of that out

i thought i heard voices hi charlie hi joey . and oh you 're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend . i 'm just kidding , i know rachel , i know . come , please come in . come in .
okay , well , we brought you some wine .
oh that is so thoughtful . she 's a keeper . and what did you bring me ?
uh , actually , that 's
underwear , a toothbrush , and van halen cd . i can use all these things
gosh , ross , you know , you seem a little
what ? fine ? because i am aren 't you ? aren 't you ? aren 't you ? you see ? who else is fine ?
okay , listen , hey , ross . why don 't you try to relax , okay ? maybe have a drink .
you know what ? that is a very good idea . i 'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas .

oh , god . so adorable . look at them sleeping there like angels .
yeah , i really cherish these moments , cause before you know it , they 're gonna be awake again .
well , they may be a handful , but they 're so cute .
yeah .
oh , god , the last time i babysat them , they did the funniest thing
i haven 't slept in four years
that 's a , that 's a long time .
you just don 't know how hard it is , phoebe . there 's just so many of them . you know , two i can handle . two 's great . you just hold one in each hand , but what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on . i 've
yeah , i know , frank . i counted them when they were coming out of my area .
sometimes i think that oh , no , no , no , i can 't say it , it 's too horrible . no .
what ?
no , i can 't .
oh my god , frank , are you thinking of leaving ? because i didn 't have those triplets so you could just run out on them
oh , no i would never do that . no . i just was thinking that , you know , maybe you could take one .
what ? you can 't separate them that 's terrible . which one ?

thank you so much for seeing us . phoebe has told us such great things about you guys .
oh , please , we 're happy to help .
we went through the same thing when we were adopting .
so , a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room , huh ?

i mean , you have a lovely home .
well , we appreciate anything you can tell us .
well , actually , i think this might help .

it 's pretty much all the information you need .
oh my god
everything is broken down into categories , and then cross-referenced , and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back .
thank you . i think i just had a tiny orgasm .
i know the process is frustrating , but it 's so worth it . adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .
that 's great . can i see the book ?

you want me to wash my hands first , don 't you ?
it 's it 's just so pretty and white .
the bathroom is down the hall , to your left .

i would have told him to do it too .
can i adopt you ?

hey , you must be owen .
yeah .
i 'm chandler . hey , i was in the scouts too .
you were ?
yeah , in fact my father was a den-mother .
huh ?
you know how to use a compass ?
i have a badge in it .
you do ? that 's fantastic
you wanna see it ?
i 'd love to , but i gotta get back to talking to your parents . they 're telling us all about how they adopted you .
what ? ?
what ?
i 'm adopted ?

i got nothing .

the first batch of margaritas was not so great , but the second batch is gooooood .
well , maybe the next batch , we could all get some .
oh , guys , this is fun , isn 't it ? you know ? just the four of us . just hangin .
dude , are you okay ? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready ?
i 'm fine hey , i 'm great i 'm just i 'm just proud of us . there 's no weirdness , no tension .
no awareness .
we make a great foursome . we should do more stuff together . ooh let 's take a trip . okay , where do you think we we can go ?

my fajitas

look , charlie , i just want you to know . ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me . you know , he normally doesn 't drink like this .
oh , you know what ? this is nothing . my father is a raging alcoholic .

oh , i 'm sorry , have i made this evening uncomfortable ?

fajitas be careful , very hot plate , very hot plate
ross , you don 't even have oven mitts on

that is gonna hurt tomorrow

okay , well , this is crazy . can 't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids , can we ?
no , of course we 're not .
insane .
i know .
alice would never go for it , right ?
oh , i don 't know , she 's pretty tired , too , i think we 've got her onboard .
well , just you know , for argument 's sake , you know , hypothetically . which one would you be willing to give up ?
huh .
frank jr.jr. ?
oh , you 'd be getting a really good one . i mean , you know , he 's really funny . like , the other day he made up this joke .
uh-huh .
what 's green and says hey , i 'm a frog ? a talking frog oh , no , you can 't have him , he 's too funny .
well , alright , that 's fine . what about leslie ?
oh , no , no . not leslie . no , she 's , she 's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .
alright , so that leaves chandler .
oh , no , no , you can 't have chandler , no . no , no . she 's my little genius . i got big hopes for her . she 's gonna be a doctor or a realtor
wow , frank . i think we just ran out of kids .
oh , i think you 're right . oh , wow . phoebe , i don 't think i can give one of them up . i mean , you know , they drive me crazy , but they 're my babies .
i 'm sorry , frank . i didn 't realise things were so bad . you know , i 'll help out more . i can i can babysit any time you want . you name the day , and i 'll be there .
how about tomorrow ?
well , that 's not good . but you know , i can move some stuff around , and i 'll be there . you and alice just take the whole day together .
you 'd do that for us ?
are you kidding ? that 's what sisters are for .
look at them aw . i love you so much . oh crap , don 't wake up , don 't wake up

where are bill and colleen ?
they 're in the kitchen getting something to eat . can you believe how nice they are ?
we have to leave
why ? what did you do in the bathroom ?
i didn 't get to the bathroom . i bumped into owen on the way , and he didn 't know he was adopted . and there 's a slight chance i may have told him .
oh my god , where 's my purse ? no , you know what ? i can replace everything in there . get that binder , and let 's go

hey .
some little snacks for everybody . oh , you don 't have to eat the sour worms . those are for owen .
i 'll go get him in a second . by the way , you should know we haven 't told him he 's adopted yet .
but kids are so intuitive . don 't you think on some level he already knows ?

i 'm adopted ?
see ? intuitive
what ? where did you hear that ?
he told me and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .
which technically now you should give back
you told him he 's adopted ?
i 'm so sorry , but you should have a sign out there or something . or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door . owen doesn 't know he 's adopted , and he also thinks that santa is real .
he isn 't ?
we have to get out of here , baby

everyone ? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey .
ooy .
and to love . ah , love . l-o-v-e , love . l is for life . and what is life without love ?
oh my god , are we supposed to answer ?
o is for oh , wow the v is for this very surprising turn of events , which i 'm still fine with by the way . e is for how extremely normal i find it . that you two are together . and now one day you might get married and have children of your own .

dude , are you okay ?
totally .
ross , you don 't seem okay .
i 'm sorry , it must be the pressure of entertaining . i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan .
wait , ross . ross . i i have to take off .
no
i 'm sorry , i have a really early class in the morning , but this has been lovely .
wasn 't it ? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel .
you 're on fire i 'll call you in the morning , okay ?
okay .
alright .

god , rachel , what ross just said that is just so
oh , that 's okay , girls tend not to like me .
bye .

okay , i guess it 's just flan for three hey , hey , that rhymed
you know what , ross ? i think we 're gonna take off too .
oh , oh . of course . god , i 'm so stupid . you guys are a couple now . i mean , you probably just want to be alone .
no , no , it 's just that it 's getting late
hey , hey , it 's fine . it 's totally fine . we 've got plenty of margaritas . it 's all good .

i don 't even know what that 's for .

you know what ? i think i 'm gonna stay here and make sure he 's okay .
yeah , that 's probably a good idea .
yeah . i 'll see you in the morning .
uh-huh . okay . you know what , joey , i don 't think he 's ever gonna be okay with this .
it doesn 't look good , does it ?

morning . here you go .
thanks . did you stay here all night ?
yeah .
so you took off my pants and shoes ?
no , no , no . you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack . look , ross , about , about rachel and i. listen , you don 't have to worry about that , okay ? because nothing is gonna happen .
what do you mean ?
well , she and i said from the beginning that we weren 't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it . and clearly
hey , what are you talking about ? i 'm fine
it 's okay , ross , alright ? i totally understand . of course you 're not fine . you 're you 're ross and rachel .
except we 're not . i mean , we haven 't been a couple in like , six years . oh my god , is that right ? has it been that long ?
that 's what i hear , yeah .
this is crazy . i mean , six years ? and because of me you guys aren 't gonna be together ? can i ask you something ? really , what is this thing with you and rachel ?
come on , i mean , you know me , you know
joey .
i 'm crazy about her .
and she feels the same way ?
i think so .
well , then , maybe it 's time we all moved on .
yeah , but , ross , i mean , you 're not okay with it .
no , but i wanna be . hey , i will be . besides , i 'm with charlie , right ? oh my god , i 'm still with charlie , aren 't i ? i mean , she didn 't see the dance , did she ?
no , no , no , no , that was that was just for me . are you sure about this ?
yeah , i 'm sure .
and we 're okay ?

hey , phoebs
hey .
uhm , we just wanna give you a heads-up . bill and colleen hate us .
owen didn 't know he was adopted , and monica told him .
what ?
still , he had to find out sometime .
yeah , but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?

i 'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident .

so , you and rachel tonight , huh ?
yeah . it 's actually our first official date
wow so tonight may be the night you 're nervous ?
naa , no . this is the part i 'm actually good at .
what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing .
it 's ok
how can you be so confident ?
well , i i know exactly what i 'm gonna do
really ? like you have a routine ?
no , no no no no . see . each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness .
really ?
no , i do six things first , i look deep in her eyes . then , i kiss her . next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh .
you mean like this ?
no not like that , no no . no , like this .
oh , i see what you mean , that 's quite nice .

i am scrappy .
exactly look , no matter what i tried to do , i couldn 't keep you out of my life . of all the people i have cut out , you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .
it 's because i 'm scrappy .
yeah , you are . and i 'm so glad that you fought your way back in , because i don 't know what i would do without you .
i won 't know what i would do without you .

oh son of a bitch

what is the matter with us ?
well , i know what 's the matter with me .
no , i mean with us , you know . i mean , is it supposed to be this difficult ?
i don 't know .

that fake british woman is a real bitch , but she sure can dance hey
hi hey , listen , can we ask you a question ? when you and monica first hooked up , was it weird going from friends to more than that ?
kinda you know , sneaking around , having to hide from you guys
no , no , no no , i mean se-x-u-ally
yeah , was there a part of you that felt like it was really wrong ?
actually , no . no , it felt right . you know , it felt like uhm i can 't believe we haven 't been doing this the whole time .

i can tell from your expressions that that 's the good news you were hoping for well , i 'm gonna go continue to spread the joy .
well , just because it happened that way for them doesn 't mean it has to happen that way for us .
yeah , yeah absolutely . i mean , just because something 's difficult doesn 't mean that you quit .
right , totally .
yeah , so we just keep trying and trying until we do it .
yeah , and if doesn 't work , then we 'll be just one of those couples that never have sex .
that 's a pla-an .

wow i did not see this coming .
i know . joey i don 't get it . i mean , i was so sure this was what i wanted .
hmmm me too

i wonder how monica and chandler could do it ?
i guess they weren 't as good friends as we are .

aah i bet you 're right .

so
yeah .
i love ya .
love you too alright , i 'm going to bed .
yeah , me too .

ooh , yeah , i 'm not going anywhere for a while .

dude , it 's chandler . let me in .

go away i don 't want to see anybody .
i know , i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me . you have to let me in .
really ? did you count mississipily ?

dude , you 're not tanned .
no , i just had to get a picture of this .

i see you later

hey guys
hey
honey , i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .
that place in vermont ? you can take a hint
wait , you can 't go away this weekend it 's emma 's birthday
yeah
we 're having a party .
well , can 't you just have the party when we get back ?
no .
no , that day that won 't be her real birthday
gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was
c 'mon you guys , this is really important to us .
well , i 'm sorry , but chandler and i could really use a weekend away . you know , to reconnect emotionally .
there 's this thing i really want us to do . i read about it in maxim
well , can 't you just go to vermont the next day ?
yeah , we want everyone to be there . as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .
and i mean , you know , you guys this is a big deal . i mean , how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle
all right , we 'll stay . we can just drive up after the party .
fine , but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party
believe me , that is not why we won 't be doing that

you know pheebs , when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find em all .
oooh , i love family traditions like that . when uhm when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food
hey guys
hi
hey , i brought the camera for emma 's video .
oh , good , good we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we 'll give it to her when she is 18 .
oh , cool wow , it 's like a time capsule
yeah
oh , just think she 's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn 't even been invented yet with friends who right now are just like babies and they 'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people
that 's the hope so , is emma awake yet ?
oh no , it 's still nap time . but she 'll be up soon .
ah , and where is joey ?
i said it 's still nap time .

hey , there is uncle joey
hey
hey , say something to emma on her 18th birthday
18 , uh ? ross joey , no
what , what ? it 's for her hot friends
when they see this you 'll be 52
and starting to think about settling down
hey joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma 's presents on ?
i 'd love to yeah joey we were supposed to bring presents ?
yeah i wrote emma a song .
oh , yeah how was i supposed to know ?
joey , it 's a birthday party .
yeah , but for a one-year-old . what 's the point the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup . just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer . and he 's standing next to this cow and the cow says el-moo yeah that 's a funny cup

hey
hey hey where 's the birthday girl ?
oh , she 's still napping
oh , sure , she was probably up all night , excited about the party she knows is happening .
look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn 't a really big deal to you , but it really is to us , ok ? emma will never have a first birthday again .
all right you 're right . we 're sorry . now let 's wake up emma and get the fun time started
no really , she didn 't sleep well last night , so we can 't wake her up .
are you freaking kidding me , green ?

hi
hey
so glad you came
i can 't believe emma is already one
i remember your first birthday ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you . he pulled on his testicles so hard we had to take him to the emergency room ross there 's something you didn 't know about your dad
hey mr. and mrs. geller let me help you with that .
thank you
oh man , this is great , uh ? the three of us together again you know what would be fun ? if we gave this present to emma from all of us
which one are you ?

i can 't believe emma is still asleep
i know , what are we gonna do ?
i 've got a plan . i 've got a plan . i 'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs . you 're gonna scream out and that 'll wake her up
i 'm not going to vermont with this monica
hey pheebs , you know what ? i was thinking since you wrote a song , maybe i could do something for emma using my talents phoebe so youre gonna hit on her ?
no , no , no my talents as an actor
oh
you know , i could like maybe i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books
or you could stick a fork in an apple
hey , i think emma might like it
oh emma might like what ?
um , my present
what did you get her ?
actually we prepared performances .
separate performances .
but equally real
well , this sounds like fun well , you know what ? actually ? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap , so would you mind performing them once now ?
sure , yeah
o k.
all right , lets get this party started , huh ? joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .
oh , great
are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared ?
hey , i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting
so , joey , what are you gonna do for us ?
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emmas books .
oh , ok , which one ?
uh , why , its a one of her favorites , uh , riding the storm out . coping with post-partum depression eesh love you forever . love you forever . by robert munsch . published by firefly books . printed in mexico . a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth , back
wow that was amazing
thank you so much for that gift
i was not ready for this today
amazing amazing .
oh , phoebe , im sorry phoebe has prepared something as well .
thats right , i 've prepared a song for emma . from my heart to hers . for theres no greater gift , than the gift of music . emma your name poses a dilemma . cause not much else rhymes with emma maybe the actor richard crenna , he played the commanding officer in rambo . happy birthday emma
is that it ?
no , of course not i also , you know , prepared a reading . sex and the single mother . finding your g-spot .
no , no , no , no , no

hello emma . happy eighteenth birthday .

yes , youll be all grown up by then . well be well your grandfather and i might not be here .
thats true this message could becoming to you from beyond the grave , emma
after all , my parents died very young .
and my cholesterols off the charts
remember , emma , heart disease kills women too
ok , cut great . that was that was just yeah
ross , um , dont forget to get a shot of emmas cake . its in a box in the fridge .
sure .
oh , you 're gonna love this cake . i got it from a bakery in new jersey , corinos .
oh my god , that place has the creamiest frosting i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
well , anyway , they make these great novelty cakes , in all different shapes , and if you give them a photo , theyll copy it in icing
oh , did you do a picture of emma ?
yes on a cake shaped like a bunny .
uh , rach ? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ? say for bachelorette parties ?
ross , what are you talking about ? oh oh my god they put my babys face on a penis
oh now its a party
why you guys this isn 't funny , all right ? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself
uh is it ok that i still think it looks delicious ?
jack , look at this .
i know what you 're thinking judy , the resemblance is uncanny
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
no , no , this is not what i ordered . ok ? i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and i need a bunny cake , right now
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis , so we can put it on the bunny . . that is a weird sentence
oh believe you me i am going to bring this cake back , i don 't even want it in my home joey , don 't touch it
i 'm so confused
yes , yes . i still want my daughters picture , but on a bunny cake . yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts

hey mon , that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake .
oh . so nice of her to pull my hair , till i dropped the key
well , you know what ? while we 're waiting , you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday , huh ? ok
hi emma it 's the year 2020 . are you still enjoying your nap ?
we 're aunt monica and uncle chandler , by the way . you may not recognize us , because we haven 't spoken to your parents in seventeen years

oh i got it ok , everyone pick a number from one to ten . alright ? whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .
ok , ten .
okay , monica picks ten , i call nine anyone else ?
no , lets just draw straws .

oh , why do you even bother ? i already ruined her first birthday and do you know how important these early experiences are ross ? very according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .
rach , she 's not going to remember this .
i guess oh , i just had such an idea of what this day would be like , you know ? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday . then we would all go into hey get out of the road you stupid student driver they have to learn
hey
what ?
it 's not bad .
oh my god look what you made it into a bunny . how did you do that ?
well , i just made these two things uhm cheeks . and then i split this to make ears .

why , you don 't like her ?
well , of course i do . what 's not to like i 'll take her in a minute but , you know , i think that you 're giving up too easy , honey . i think that you need to fight for her

absolutely yes , you say to him i 'm sorry mike i can 't live without her , she means too much to me
ok , i 'll fight for her . ok oh , wait , oh i just realized if i do that , that means you don 't get her .

that 's good i liked it , they didn 't . joey , for god 's sake , go to work .

what did i just say ?

you still here ?
yes , and i have to say , i am not just hurt . i am insulted . when i tell somebody i did something
ok whoah-hey let me just stop you right there , ok ? first , you lied , right ? then , you lied about lying , ok ? then you lied about lying about lying , ok ? so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying stop lying
why are you so sure i didn 't watch this tape ?
you wanna know wh ? you wanna know why ?
well , this is going well .
here 's how i know you didn 't watch the tape , ok ? if you had seen what was on this tape , believe me , you would have some comments . alright , now remember , i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan .

joey says ichiban . it displays a few girls dancing around and joey fills most of the screen , he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying lipstick for men it goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick . in the end he says seductively ichiban lipstick for men and
and that 's how i know you didn 't watch the tape .

he really is a chameleon .

well , gladys say hello to your new home
oh , my
wow oh , she 's so nice and big oh , monica , where are you going to display gladys oh so proudly ?
i haven 't really settled on a spot yet
well , hey how about right above the tv ? . that way , it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door
yeah , yeah and you can get rid of that french poster .
i like that poster
really ? it doesn 't have anything coming out of it . or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom ?
oh there 's nothing above your bed
are you still here ?

oh hi hello uh , have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions ? uhm your grandmother 's nickname , perhaps ? aunt margaret 's pants size ?
i 've come here to apologize . i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the interview process .
no stop
anyway , i 've decided to offer you the grant .
really ?
well there is just one small stipulation
i have to break up with charlie ?
hey , you got one right

you 're crazy .
crazy , or romantic ?
crazy
ooor
get out

o-oh my god
what ?
joey , what is this thing doing here ?
i got it from monica . she sold it to me for a very reasonable price .
joey , we 're not keeping this
but it 's an original buffay
alright , fine . you can keep it . as long as you don 't mind that she 's haunted .
hey ? what ? what ? wey whoo what ? what ?
well , legend has it joey , that she comes alive when you 're asleep .

she climbs out of the frame , and then drags her half-a-body across the floor , just looking for legs to steal . and then with her one good hand , she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob .
get that legless witch out of here

hey i sold that to joey .
well , why i told him it 's haunted . two can play at this game .
no , too late . you can 't give it back
yes i can
no you can 't . she 's yours
she 's yours
she 's yours
she 's yours

hey
she 's mine
she 's m-i-i-ne
she 's mine
she 's mine
you guys you guys you don 't have to fight over her anymore . whoever doesn 't get gladys gets glynnis .
i want gladys
she 's mine
she 's mine
she 's mine
she 's mine

look , i 'm sorry i didn 't give them your tape . and i promise , next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not .
that 's not the point chandler . the point is that you lied .
i know . you 're right . what 's it gonna take for you to forgive me ?

oh my god

excellent
now , what do you say ?
lying is wrong
and ? and ?
i 'm a pretty little girl .
i knew it

your ex-boyfriend is insane .
did you get the grant ?
no i didn 't , and you want to know why ? because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you .
what ?
yeah . he wouldn 't give me the grant , because i wouldn 't give you up .
benji isn 't in love with me . i mean , he broke up with me . and besides , he 's a very ethical man .
really ? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review , who was the voice of underdog ?
i 'm sure he was just joking , ross .
if you don 't believe me , let 's go talk to him , okay ? i 'm telling you , he didn 't ask me one paleontological question .
seriously ?
oh , i 'm sorry , no . he did ask me one . uhm how do you spell mboscodictiosaur ?
well , if it 's like the lake mbosco in congo , then m-b-o
damnit

dr. geller ? charlie what are you what are you doing here ?
i want you to tell her everything . about the deal you tried to make with me , about the crazy questions you wally cox that 's the voice of underdog
like i tried to tell you in the interview ross , this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia .
no , no , no . don 't do that i want you to look her in the eyes , and tell her the truth .
benji ?
alright , it 's true . i behaved horribly . but it 's only because i still love you . and i would do anything to have you back in my life .
too little , too late , benji
i can 't believe this .
i never should have broken up with you . i think about you all the time . i mean , do you ever still think about me ?
no
yes
what ?
i don 't know what to say , benji . this is all so romantic .
or
listen , i know , i may be way out of bounds here , but is there any chance you will take me back ?
maybe
sweetie , this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable .
oh god i am so sorry , but i mean it 's there 's so much history between us , you know
i 'm sorry too

i love you
i love you too
okay , that 's it . we are seeing other people

gladys ?

ha ha ha , third time this week . man , this does not get old .
you 're mean
oh , don 't be such a baby

hey you guys
hey
hey , what are you doing ?
oh , figuring out our wedding plans .
that 's funny , we were doing the same thing
yeah
it 's really crazy the hall , the dress , the food i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was
yeah it is really pricey . i mean , i freaked when i first heard the numbers .
so what did you two do about it ?
it was pretty simple actually , i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions , wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .
there 's no way around it pheebs , you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money .
i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry .
yeah , and i 'm responsible for just like half of that .
but really , it does seem like this money could be put to better use ?
are you serious ?
yeah now , how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ?
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more .
i 've got to say you guys , that 's an incredible gesture
maybe you do that next time you get married
no , no , no . the next time it 's gonna be a hawaii at sunset . but maybe the time after that

hey
hey
what 's going on ?
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment .
we ?
you know you don 't want me to help . you can 't have it both ways
hey , is this person who decides whether or not you get a baby ?
kind of . she 's coming by to interview us and see where we live .
and it has to go perfectly , because if she doesn 't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .
hey , maybe i should stop by she could be a soap opera fan it 's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity .
little people ?
celebrity .
ok , so i think i 'm just about done here , unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere , like porn or cigarettes ?
what ? no
chandler ?
i don 't , and i 'm offended by the insinuation
ok , so there 's not a magazine under the couch , or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank , or a filthy video in the vcr ?
i 'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine , but that tape is not mine .
it isn 't mine
well , i guess we 'll never know whose it is

may i help you ?
yes . we 're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children .
well , any contribution , large or small , is always appreciated .
well , i think you 're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
well , this is very generous
and we don 't want any recognition . this is completely anonymous .
completely anonymous . from two kind strangers .
mr. x and phoebe buffay .
well if you like , we can include your names in our newsletter .
not necessary .
buffay is spelled b-u-f-f-a-y .
and x is spelled uhm mike hannigan .
right . well , on behalf of the children thank you both very much .
sure , i so glad we did this . it feels so good
it does . it feels really good
oh , look and we get these free t-shirts
oh , actually , that 's the shirt i wore to the gym .
mhm it 's moist .

hi
hi emma will be up in a minute
oh , good
oh hey ross listen , i heard about you and charlie . i 'm really sorry .
oh , that 's ok . i 'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there .
absolutely .
there was one she 's it all the rest look like they should live under a bridge
so , uhm what are you gonna do today ?
well , i was thinking of taking emma to the playground
oh my god , what ?
like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire
ok , look , ross . i do not want emma going to the playground .
be-caaauuuse
all right , well , if you must know i had a traumatic swing incident when i was little .
seriously ?
yes , i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain . and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair and it was uneven for weeks
and you made it through that ? i wonder who 's gonna play you in the movie
ok , fine you can make fun of me . i do not want emma going there . and i was thinking claire danes .
look , i 'm sorry to hear about your tragedy , ok ? but the swings are perfectly safe , and besides emma loves them . you know what , you should come with us and you 'll see
ross , those things go like 40 miles an hour ok ? when you 're and there is that moment when you are at the top , when you just don 't know if you 're gonna return back to earth
space is filled with orbiting children . look , please , just come on , you know , when youll see the look on emmas face , i swear you wont regret it .
all right
good , you dont want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children , do you ?
irrational , huh ? all right , well , ill remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment
oh , yeah , thats the same , i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings

oh my god , the adoption lady is early
ok , ok , here we go .
ok .
here we go . stand up straight . big smile .
hello , is this the creepy residence ?
were waiting for the adoption lady , but , hey , im glad youre here . i was cleaning this morning and i found this . i dont know if you wanna use it , but
awe , this is so sweet of you but you know what ? i wont be needing a veil , i actually wont be wearing a dress at all
i told you i am not coming to a naked wedding
no , no , no , were not having a big reception , we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity .
thats crazy . i am sorry . i just cant imagine giving up my one wedding day like that

its ok , its ok . i made my decision . what i really want is a great big wedding
yay
but you already gave all your money to charity
well , ill just ask for it back
i dont think you can do that
why not this is her wedding day , this is way more important than some stupid kids
thats sweet , honey , but save something for the adoption lady .

ok , careful .
ok .
careful , watch her hair . watch her hair
rach , shes got like three hairs

wow are you here to make another donation the same day ? i dont think that thats ever happened before .
gay , go .
oh my god , i love your shirt
the donation we made earlier , we k , we w , we want it back .
excuse me ?
yeah . see , that money was for a big wedding , that we thought we didnt want , but it turns out we do .
so youre asking us to refund your donation to the children ?
yeah this feels really good .
i am sorry . i am , but this wedding is just really important to me .
hey , its not my business , besides its probably a good thing . we really would have been spoiling the children , all those food , and warm clothing
hey , thats not fair a persons wedding is important and especially to me ok ? i didnt have a graduation party and i didnt go to prom . and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever . so i
she could have been talking about either one of us .

hi , i am laura , i am here for your adoption interview .
hi , i am monica and this is chandler . please come in .
thank you
would you like something to drink ?
oh , water would be fine .
ok . great . i am so glad that you are here . were really excited about getting this process started .
oh , because we love kids . love em to death.well , not actually to death , that 's just a figure of speech we love kids the appropriate amount as allowed by law .
your place is just lovely .
ah , thank you . this building does have a wholesome family feel to it .
you know , i i feel like i 've been here before . are any other couples in the building adopting ?
is that that couple on the first floor ? because we should get a baby before them . yeah that guy tried to sell me drugs .
but other than that wholesome , wholesome building .
oh
what ?
i just realized why i remember this place .
really ? what is it ?
oh , it 's nothing . i went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn 't end very well .
ohh that wouldn 't by any chance be joey tribbiani ?
yes
of course it was
yeah , we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn 't .
rat bastard
so you 're not friends with him ?
oh god no nope , no , no , no . no no , no . nope no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . no no
well , i 'm sorry i brought it up . so , are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child
hellooo ? anybody in there order a celebrity ? ow
what was that ?
oh , it 's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here . he 's great with kids though .

oh , oh ross , oh my god , are you okay ?
son of a bitch oh relax i didn 't say the f word
ross , see i told you , those swings are evil alright , that is it . that is the last time emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life .
no no , no , no , no , okay , it wasn 't the swing 's fault . it was my fault and kind of that kids fault . who is still laughing . nice .
ross , c 'mon , please . can we just get out of here , before somebody else gets hurt ?
no wait , okay , okay , i have an idea . i want you to get on the swing , okay ? and you 'll see that there 's nothing to be afraid of .
i know what this is all about you 've always been jealous of my hair .
look , i just think you 're an adult , okay ? and you should get over your silly fears .
alright fine . i 'll do it .
good .
if you hold a spider .
what ? where ? where ?
if you hold a spider .
i know .

guys ? everything ok ? it 's me , joe
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaa-doption
what 's going on ?
oh , just like i said . that crazy bert roaming the halls .
guys ?
keep on roaming bert we don 't want any crazy today
what 's going on ?
we 'll talk to you later , bert . everythng 's fine

everything doesn 't sound fine
is he alright out there by himself ?
oh yeah he has a caretaker . his older brother ernie .
bert and ernie
you can 't make this stuff up

you never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen . oh , ugh . i 'm sorry about that .
oh it ended okay . one of my friends shot him .
well , hey , at least you 're getting a proper wedding . i mean , you really deserve that .
yeah , i really do . you know , i had nothing growing up . just like the kids i took the money from .
no no , no . i see where this is going . don 't make me go back there .
look , i can 't have a wedding with this money now . it 's tainted .
alright , fine . we 'll give the money back .
and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time , my friend hasn 't shot anyone in a really long time .

well , i must say , this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in .
oh , by the way , you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture , because , believe me , you won 't find any porn or cigarettes under there
oh well , actually , before we look around , let me make sure i have everything i need up to here

why don 't i show you the baby 's room ?

what the hell are you doing ?
well , you wouldn 't let me in , so i thought you were in trouble .
well , we 're not .
but you called me bert ? that 's our code word for danger
we don 't have a code word .
we don 't ? we really should . from now on , bert will be our code word for danger .

so that was the baby 's room .
what room should we see next ?
any room that isn 't behind this couch
some people don 't get him , but i think he 's really funny .

i did not care for that
you have to get out of here . you slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed , so she can 't see you .
ok , ok
ok

what ?
i forgot my bat .

what are you doing here ?
bert bert bert bert

i can explain joey
uhm ok uhm well , yeah you have got some nerve , coming back here . i can 't believe you never called me .
excuse me ?
oh yeah probably you don 't even remember my name . it 's joey , by the way . and don 't bother telling me yours , because i totally remember it lady . yeah i waited weeks for you to call me .
i gave you my number , you never called me .
no , no don 't try to turn this around on me , ok ? i 'm not some kind of social work , ok , that you can just do .
well , i 'm pretty sure i gave you my number .
really ? think about it . come on you 're a beautiful woman , smart , funny , we had a really good time , huh ? if i had your number , why wouldn 't i call you ?
i don 't know well , maybe i 'm wrong i 'm sorry
no , no , hey , no too late for apologies ok ? you broke my heart . you know how many women i had to sleep with to get over you ?
joey , wait
no i waited a long time , i can 't wait anymore
i 'm sorry that you had to see that . i 'm so embarrassed
oh , that 's really ok .
yeah , that we totally understand . dating is hard .
boy , you people are nice and i 've got to say i think you 're going to make excellent parents .

laura

ross

hey guys
hi
hey
we need to talk to you about something .
yeah . we don 't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year .
what ?
hey
are you kidding ?
well , it 's just with uhm , work and the stress of adoption , we just don 't feel like we have the energy . plus , we don 't think it 's fair that every year the burden falls on us .
that doesn 't sound like you that 's monica talking
no , no we made this decision together .
she 's putting words in your mouth
don 't you put words in people 's mouths , you put turkey in people 's mouths
i can 't believe this this is emma 's first thanksgiving
no , it 's not
it 's not ? when was she born ?
well , personally i think it 's great you 're giving yourself a break .
thank you , pheebs
sure . it 's just as well i mean , last year wasn 't very good . i think she 's losing her touch .
what ? you are way off , lady
am i ? really ? am i ? well , why don 't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong well , think about it , think about it , you 'll be trying to top than you did last year . you 'd be in competition with yourself .
that 's my favourite kind okay , we are doing this
don 't let yourself get manipulated this way
hey , stay out of this , chandler this is between me and me
we are supposed to make these decisions together did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you ?

hey
hi happy thanksgiving
oh , yeah , happy needless-turkey-murder day .
you guys , i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker . could you pick them up for me ?
you 're not making the pies yourself ?
no , no , no , i don 't make chocolate pies . when i was younger i-i enter in this pie-eating contest . i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick .
did you at least win the contest ?
2 minutes , 12 pies and a part of one tin okay , i see you guys at 4 .
can 't wait
this dinner is gonna be so great in your face , last year me

hey rach .
yeah .
what 's emma doing today ?
well , let 's see uh i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop . why ?
well , i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant .
oh my god that 's the creepiest thing i 've ever heard
okay , but , well , before you say no , my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she 's a real dog
oh phoebe , all babies are beautiful
oh okay .
phoebe , just the idea of pitting one baby against another , i mean , you know , and judging who 's cuter just for a trophy
and a thousand dollars .
is something i 'm very interested in oh please , do not tell ross . he still believes that what 's in the inside is important
okay , oh , and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .
where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?
well , i was thinking
oh , take the clothes of joey 's cabbage patch kid .
yeah

did someone drop the baton again ?
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?
i don 't get older . i just get better
you know what just occurred to me ? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us . i mean , we could be getting a baby soon
you don 't know that .
somebody is gonna pick us .
yeah , but we haven 't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks
i 'm telling ya it 's gonna happen . next year it 's gonna be you , me and the little hemingway bing . what , he 's my favourite author
name one of his books .
the firm ?
ok , let 's see uhm , okay , the turkey is in the oven , the stuffing is ready
you know , you always cook this meal all by yourself . let me help this year .
oh , chandler , that 's sweet . but you don 't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .
i 'm serious , let me do something , just not the turkey or the stuffing , nothing high profile .
ok , let 's see oh , the cranberry sauce , it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it .
tell me more .
okay , i 'm gonna go check on something across the hall . you start by washing these not with soap
you obviously haven 't tasted my palmolive potatoes

hey hey , guess what joey has
three tickets to today 's rangers game
dude , i wanted him to guess .
oh .
oh my god
yeah , they 're great seats too
guess where they are ?
center ice .
did i do something to you ?
hmm , the game 's at one .
so ?
dinner is at four , we 'll never gonna make it back .
so we 'll leave before it 's over , we 'll be back in time .
you say that now , but it could take us a long time to get back home . plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .
dude , two times that happened
look , monica has been working hard all day , she didn 't wanna host this thing in the first place , we shouldn 't go
he 's right , man .
right , i guess . alright , so see you at four .
okay . and get ready to taste my very special cranberries . or should i say chanberries
that 's some gentle comedy , dude .
we 're still going at the game , right ?
yeah
yeah .

this is contestant number sixteen , rebecca
hey .
oh phoebe , listen . well , i think we gotta go . this place is really freaking me out . i 've been watching this guy over there , i don 't think he came with a kid
we can 't leave now there was this one baby , haley , who was favourite to win and she got croup , so she had to stay home this competition just blew wide open , folks
phoebe , i think it 's just too weird , i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on
oh , i know , we should have been more prepared . it 's okay . now , the way i see it , our real competition now is cameron . oh my god , they just took her sweater off . look at those arms hello michelin man .
oh , phoebe come on you know what , it 's already three o 'clock and they haven 't even gotten to emma 's group yet . we gotta go , we got dinner
but emma 's got what it takes , she could go all the way
phoebe , you have to calm down .
okay . rachel , the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma
really ?
yeah
you heard them say that ?
yeah
all right , okay . alright , let 's give to these babies something to cry about
good oh yay let 's get down to business emma needs some makeup
no , what ?
well , she 's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants
no phoebe , i am not letting you put makeup on my baby
why not
because i already did

oh , bob , get off the guy
oh what a game , huh ?
i know , yeah .
i can 't believe chandler is missing this
yeah . i am sorry he 's not here too , but i got to say , i am really enjoying nacho chair .
yeah , i 'd probably enjoy it more if you didn 't keep batting my hand away .
ohhhh these seats are great
i know , i know when i was here for holidays on ice i was sitting so far away michelle kwan couldn 't read my banner
wow , hey , we 'd better get going . if we don 't leave right now , we 'll be late for dinner .
oh , but it 's a kind game so we 're a little late , you know , the girls will be there , let 's stay just for one more goal .
i don 't know
one more fight
okay .
okay .

where is everybody ? they 're forty-five minutes late
i can 't believe they are not here i slave and i slave for what ? they 've ruined cranberry day

how late are we ?
forty-five minutes .

i know . have you considered pageanting ?
i can 't believe they called , and we 're actually getting a baby .
oh , i know how you feel

that is the exact same thing .

hi
hey
hey
we 're just here to say goodbye , we 're off to ohio .
oh , right your adoption interview
yep , we 're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby .
i can 't believe it . when you guys come back , you 're gonna have a baby that is so weird
and so incorrect
she 's only a couple of months pregnant . she liked our application but who knows if she 's gonna like us .
come on , she 's gonna love you guys
uhm , thank you , but we 're really trying not to get our hopes up .
and a lot could still get in our way .
yeah . i mean , this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better
what are you gonna name the baby ?
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .
but just think , ok ? what if everything goes right ? what if this woman does pick you guys ?
oh my god . she 's gonna pick us
so we 're standing firm on the not getting our hopes up ?
you know , i know that things could still go wrong but if they don 't ? if this works out , we 're gonna have a baby chandler , a baby
yes , but
oh my god , it 's gonna work we 're gonna make it work i 'm gonna be a mummy and you 're gonna be a daddy all right , i 'll see you suckers . i 'm gonna get me a baby she leaves

oh , that 's sarah . no , no . don 't you get any ideas , ok ? no , i 'm not setting you up with any more of my friends

mandy .
mandy , uh ? uh really hot blonde , big boobs ?

ok , i may not have treated your friends well in the past , but i have grown up a lot , really . honest , rach ?
well , believe it or not , it 's true . when joey and i were together , he was wonderful . he was thoughtful and mature . and for the one week that we went out , he didn 't sleep with anybody else

damnit i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool
well , you know , if you want fashion help , rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow . you 're more than welcome to come with us , right ?
really ? that would be great . i mean , i have to do something , she kinda teased me about how i dress .
i can see why , nice shirt
you 're wearing the same shirt .
stupid gap on every corner

please , make yourself comfortable and i will back in a moment with erica .
ok , thank you . uh , well this is it . are you ok ?
yeah . just weird , you know . it 's like hi , i 'm chandler . may i have the human growing inside you ?
uh , we 're gonna be great .
you 're gonna be great .
well obviously
monica , chandler . i 'd like you to meet erica .
hi . it is so , so nice to meet you .
hi
thank you so much for agreeing to see us .
hi .
i 'll let you get acquainted .
ok .
so , it 's monica and chandler . i only know you as file 0w33815-d .
that 's what our friends call us .
gosh , you know , you 're just such an amazing couple . it 's kind of intimidating .
i don 't know about that .
you 're kidding me ? i mean , it 's enough that you are a doctor . but on top of it , you 're married to a reverend ?
i don 't think that 's exactly
let her finish , doctor .

hey
hey .
oh , my friend sarah had a great time last night .
well
yeah so you 're gonna call this one back ?
nope .
what are you talking about ? sarah 's great
oh , really ? you know what your great friend did ? we 're out to dinner , ok ? we 're getting along , having a really nice time . i was thinking she was really cool . and then , out of nowhere

thats it ? thats why you wont go out with her again ? so , she took some fries , big deal
hey , hey , look its not about a few fries its about what the fries represent .
what ?
all food
im sorry , i cant believe i set you up with such a monster
hey , hey , hey , hey . look . i take a girl out , she can order whatever she wants the more , the better all right ? just dont order a garden salad and then eat my food thats a good way to lose some fingers

oh
hi
thank god youre here . listen to this
what ?
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries
oh oh , no

what ? you know about the plate thing ?
oh , yeah . joey doesnt share food . i mean , just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and
you wouldnt let her have a grape ?
oh no not me emma

joey doesnt share food
well , i still think that its a stupid reason not to call someone again . you are calling her and if you need to , just get an extra plate of fries for the table
i like that a sharing buffer yeah ill order some extra fries maybe a plate of onion rings . yeah . and a shrimp cocktail . and some buffalo wings . maybe an individual pizza , uh ? and some mozzarella sticks . what were we talking about ?

this place is awesome
you know , we should just go , im not gonna find anything here this stuff is ridiculous

ah , this place is great
wow
rach , come on , im not gonna wear any of this nothing silver . . ok ? nothing with hair and nothing with padlocks on it .
ross , look , i know that some of this stuff is out there , but i mean , come on , look at this , look at this sweater . i mean , this is just beautiful
wow , this is really soft . three hundred and fifty dollars ?
yeah , down from seven hundred , you are saving like two hundred bucks
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today .
hey , check this out its totally you
wow
yeah

actually this looks like pretty good yeah boys will be boys ?
what ? they will be
all right , thats it , im getting out of here .
no , no , no , no ross , wait come on you know , theres other stuff . heres a nice shirt , look at these nice pants
uh , actually these might look pretty good on me .
yes , they will you know what you should do ? just go take a walk , all right ? i know your size and im im gonna pick up some really good stuff for you .
really ?
yes and i know what looks sexy on guys . please , just wear what i suggest , and shes gonna go nuts for you .
so , youre saying , uh , if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers ?
why do men keep talking to me like this ?

so , the fact that i am a doctor , and my wifes a reverend , thats important to you ?
yeah , i read some great applications , but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child
amen .
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor
uh , good hands . healing hands .
reverend , can i ask ? does the bible say anything about adoption ?
it says do it . and behold she did adopt onto them a baby . and it was good .
wow .
yeah , wow .
i was wondering you both have such serious jobs . would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?
oh , you know , my flock is good , i mean , yeah , my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point . good flock . flock , flock , flock .
being a doctor must take up a lot of time .
no-ot for me it doesnt .

so , hows everything going in here ?
were great , i think i may have asked all my questions .
do you have any question for erica ?
yeah , actually . so , you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?
yes , our system assures total anonimity . were very proud of it .
you should be . youre really on top of stuff
well , then if theres nothing else , then the two of us should talk .
actually , i dont think we have to .
we dont ?
yeah , when i read about you two , i was pretty sure i wanted you , but i just thought we should meet face to face . . i 've made my decision . i choose them .
oh my god , this is great this is so great . did you hear that ?
yeah , i did .
hey , thank you . thank you so much . . you are so going to heaven

we got some really great stuff
yeah , yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra 's i got .
oh really ? do you wanna try some of them on for me ?
oh okay . wait , are we in joey 's imagination ?
oh no i took one of ross bags by mistake , and one of mine is missing .
oh , well , ross probably has it , you can get it from him later .

so ? what do you think ?
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore
yeah yeah rachel picked it out for me . she told me to trust her and you know what ? i 'm glad i did i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .
dude , i really don 't think you should be wearing that .
oh , i see , somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?
looks like someone is the ladies
you 're just jealous because you couldn 't pull this off . yeah , now if you 'll excuse me i have a date . see ? all eyes on me

we are not signing those papers .
why not ?
it 's wrong . they made a mistake . they think we 're somebody else .
god works in mysterious ways .
you have gotta stop
but she liked us .
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .
well , if you think about it , i am kind of like a reverend . i mean , as a chef , i serve god , by feeing the hungry and poor .
your veal chop is $ 34,95
c 'mon chandler , i think we have been given an opportunity . i mean , the mistake has already been made . they are writing up the paper right now .
but we are not the one she chose how can you feel okay about this ?
because we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us .
i know
i mean , who knows how long it 's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ? what if , what if no one ever picks us ?
oh , honey
please please , we are so close .
monica , i want a baby too , but this woman is giving away her child . she deserves to know who it 's going to . monica okay , right .
so , we 'll tell the truth and who knows , maybe she 'll like us for us .
maybe she will . uh why couldn 't i have been a reverend ?
you 're jewish .
technicality

a garden salad for the lady
oh , that looks great good ordering
seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries . enjoy
mmmh , those fries look delicious .
oh , i didn 't know you liked french fries . help yourself what 's mine is yours .
oh wow , are those stuffed clams ?
uuuh yes , they are my stuffed clams .

how about those fries though , huh ?
they are delicious
you are beautiful , you know that ?
oh , that is so sweet
oh okay

now look what you did
what ? what is the matter with you ?
i don 't like it when people take food off of my plate , okay ?
but you just said what 's mine is yours ?
well , i didn 't mean it
fine , i 'm sorry , i didn 't think it was that big a deal .
i 'm sorry , i 'm overreacting . okay , it 's just when it comes to food , i have certain rules , okay , i mean there are things you do and you now , things that you don 't do .

wow , this place looks great .
oh you are gonna love it and i 'm so glad , we 're finally doing this .
me too

i really am sorry about , you know before . i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you .

yes , that 's raspberry coule .
so stupid , ordering cheesecake , trying to be healthy .
oh my god
oh , all right , i 'll just have what she 's having instead .
oh , i 'm sorry sir , that was our last piece .
mmmm mmm

oh yeah , sure . no problem .

what are you doing ? i thought you don 't share food .
sure i do . coule ?
no . if i can 't have your clams , you can 't have my dessert . this is a two way street .

yeah , of course . i can control myself .

stop staring at me

why , just a tiny little

oh-oh
time lapse

i 'm not even sorry .

hi
hey .
hey .
so , these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption . there 's a lot to go over , but i 'll explain everything as we go through it .
i-is is that a picture ?
yeah . it 's a sonogram they took of the baby last week . i thought you might want to see it .
look , doctor

i don 't understand .
the agency must have made some mistake . my wife is not a reverend and i 'm not a doctor .
what ?
that 's impossible .
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you 'd like .
i 'll go check your file . excuse me .
so who are you ?
well , our names really are monica and chandler . we 're from new york .
yeah , but the important thing to know about us , is how much we would care for this little baby .
so you lied to me before ?
well , we bore false witness see i could be a reverend .
i can 't believe this .
but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider
giving you my baby ? you think i 'd give you my child after this ?
well , you don 't have to decide right now , but if you could just look at our file
i don 't want to look at your file this is over .

erica wait
i 've nothing to say to you .
you have every reason to be upset . we did lie . but only because we 've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long . now we don 't know how long it 's gonna be before we can get another chance again .
why don 't you ask the reverend to pray on it ?
erica , please . just consider us . ask them to see our file . our last name 's bing . my wife 's a chef and i 'm in advertising .
oh yeah . i actually liked you guys . but it doesn 't matter , because what you did was wrong .
but you did like us . and you should . my wife 's an incredible woman . she 's loving and devoted and caring . and don 't tell her i said this but the woman 's always right i love my wife more than anything in this world . and i it kills me that i can 't give

you still want that baby ?

god bless you chandler bing

turns out this sweater is made for a woman .
so , why are you still wearing it ?
because it 's soft hey , so how was your date ?
ooh not so good .
well , looks like it 's just the two of us tonight , huh old buddy ?
yeah , and you know what ? we could do a lot worse .

phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester .
they went in together . so sorry .
oh my god oh my god thats awful what did you think of the house ?

what ?
monica , you understand what we are saying , right ?
yeah , sure uhm , i 'm devastated , obviously did you think the neighborhood was homey ?
hey
you son of a bitch
is it me , or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?
phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and em they think you 're having an affair .
who 's nancy ?
what 's going on ?
ok , alright , you guys , you 'd better sit down , this is pretty big .
yeah i 'm not having an affair . nancy is our realtor .
i knew he couldn 't be with a woman for 45 minutes
why do you have a realtor ?
uhm , she has been showing us houses outside of the city .
what ?
are you serious ?
when we found out that we 're gonna get this baby , chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn 't want to raise a kid in the city .
so you 're gonna move ?
oh my god .
shouldn 't we all vote on stuff like this ?
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city ? i 'm doing it , ross is doing it , sarah jessica parker is doing it
and that 's great for you guys , but we want a lawn and a swingset
and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by .
so you wanna buy a house in the 50 's ?
have you thought about what you would be giving up ? you can 't move out of the city , what if you want chinese food at 5am ? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door ?
you know what , if you wanna look for a house , that 's okay .
no , no , it 's not , don 't listen to him i 'm gonna thump you
it 's ok , because they have to get it out of their system , okay , but you 're going to realize , this is the only place , you wanna be .

i just don 't want to be alone tonight .
ok , well , uh , i can maybe grab a sleeping bag , or oh , oh . . no , rach i 'm sorry , i just don 't think this , this , this is a good idea .
wait , we won 't know that until we do it , will we ?
no , look , uh . you are upset about your father and you 're feeling vulnerable and i just don 't feel it would be right , i 'd feel like i 'd be , you know , taking advantage of you .
taking advantage ? i 'm giving you the advantage , enjoy
look , i 'm sure it would be great , but i-i think one of us has to be thinking clearly , so , i 'm gonna go
wow . ok .
i 'll see you in the morning .
mhm-mh
haven 't had sex in four months , i should get a medal for that

thanks so much for taking me to all those places . i had a great time .
oh , i 'm glad . listen , i want to apologize about chandler , though . i just did not see this coming .
new york is awesome
what is with you ?
yeah , i 've been to these places before , but i 've never really seen them , you know .
yeah , you miss alot , when you 're moo-ing .
thanks so much for showing me around .
oh it was our pleasure . we are so much enjoying getting to know you .
well , if there is anything else you wanna know
oh , uhm , okay , uhm , do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father ?
oh , sure . yeah , well , he was my high school boyfriend . captain of the football team , really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .
that 's great .
yeah it 's almost definitely him .
how 's that now ?
well , there is a chance it 's another guy . i mean , i have only ever been with two guys , but they sorta overlapped .
so , what does the other guy do ? does he go to college too ?
no , he 's in prison .
was he falsely accused of something ?
no he killed his father with a shovel . but other than that , he 's a great guy .
i 'll bet his dad doesn 't think so .

are you awake ?
of course i 'm awake . assume from now on that i 'm always awake
alright , we don 't know that it 's him . i mean , it could be the football guy .
honey , it 's us . of course it 's the shovel-killer .
alright , lets say that it is him , would we not want the baby ? no would we treat him any differently ?
i 'd keep an eye on him we have to find out which one the father is .
how ?
i dunno , aren 't there tests for these things , right ?
yeah , but maybe we 're just over-reacting .
pff , easy for you to say , he 's a father killer . he probably loves him mommy . he 's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm

we will now count from one to five . un , deux , trois , quatre , cinq .
huh , un , blu , bla , flu , flenk
good job .
thank you .

hey joey .
hey
listen , i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and , and i know , i was too impatient . so lets try it again .
oh , no , that 's okay , i don 't need your help . i worked on it myself and i gotta say , i am pretty good
really , can i hear some of it .
sure , sure . ok , bleu de la bleu , de la blu bla bleu see ?
well , you 're not , you 're not you 're not again , you 're not speaking french
oh well i think i am , yeah and i think i 'm definitely gonna get the part .
how could you possibly think that ?
for one thing , the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job

hey rach , can you grab me a cup of coffee ?
sure .
you 've been quiet all morning . is everything okay ?
hmm-hmm .
you sure you 're alright ?
yep .
o-kay . well , i 'm gonna go grab us some breakfast .
fyi
there it is
in the future , when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex just do it .
wait , wait , you 're mad at me about last night ? i was just trying to do the right thing .
really ? well , it seems to me if you 'd done the right thing , i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed , i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied
well
oh stop that
i can 't believe this . i was just being a good guy . i treated you with respect and understanding .
oh , that is so hot . she walks around him to the other side
hey , i was looking out for you .
oh , really , well ross , you know what ? i am a big girl . i don 't need someone telling me what is best for me .
i gotta say , i have not had sex a lot of times before , this is the worst ever .
oh , really , really ? well , it wasn 't very good for me either .
hey you know what ? you know what ? to avoid this little thing in the future , let 's just say , you and me , never having sex again .
what ?
that 's right , sex is off the table . i am never having sex with you again . dr. green , are you feeling better ?

hey how was lunch ?
we had a good time . by the way , i wanted to ask you something . it would really mean a lot to me , if the baby was a boy , that you name him after my father , jiminy billy bob
oh , really ?
no you we 're right , that was fun i 'm gonna go finish packing .
o-okay . so , is she gonna take the test ?
nope , she doesn 't have to , i found out who the father is .
oh god . it 's shovely-joe , isn 't it ?
no it 's not .
how do you know ?
well , it turns out that erica didn 't pay much attention in sex ed class , because the thing she did with that prison guy it 'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way .
oh god what was it ? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do ?
the thing we never do .
shovely joe

whenever you 're ready joey .
right . dja bu bu claude . uh , c 'est la pu les la lu blah bloo .
i 'm sorry , what 's going on ?
dude , come on french it u-up

you know what . i think this audition is over .
uh , excuse me . uh , i am regin philange . i was passing by when i heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my french town of este lauder .
you really think this man is speaking french ?
sa-sa-saw
coutez , je vais vous dire la vrit . c 'est mon petit frre . il est un peu retard .

alors , si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui
good job , little buddy . that was some really good french . but i think we 're gonna go with someone else for the part .
ah . all right . but my french was good ?
it was great .
oh-hoh ha-hah see
merci . au revoir .
yeah-hah . toute-de-le-fruit .

emma 's down for the night .
oh , good .
so uh i guess i wanna take off .
okay hey listen , just before you go i-i again , i just wanna say thank you for coming with me .
oh , no problem .
and also , you know i uh , i was thinking about what you said , you know , about the whole sex thing and it 's probably not a great idea to go down that road again .
thank you . i 'm glad you agree .
it 's a shame though , i mean , when we did it , it was pretty good .
yeah yeah , that 's true .
hey uhm , do you remember that one really great time ?
oh , ye-ah
you know it was you 're uhm birthday
valentine 's day
oh yeah
well , i guess that 's all in the past , now .
hmmm-mmmm .
not even one more time ?
not even once .
no matter how much we want it .
even if we want it really bad .
that 's what we decided .
uhm , right
it 's kinda hard though
yeah .
you know , when two people have a connection , you know , that 's just seems like such a waste .
i hate waste .
ross ?
yes ?
just so you know with us it 's never off the table .
damn it . it 's never off the table .

okay , can you really tapdance ?
no .
it 's off the resum .
archery ?
no .
horseback riding ?
would fall off a lot .
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds ?
that i can do .
come on you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds ?
all right , watch me okay , you time me . ready ?
ready go

previously on friends
how did the job stuff go ?
he offered me one .
you know what ? this calls for a bottle of israels finest .
the job is in paris .
fade out
oh , god please , somebody say something .
so if you take this job you 'll be moving to paris ?
or facing a bitch of a commute .
i know , it 's huge , and it 's scary , and it 's really far , far away from you guys , but this is such an incredible opportunity for me . and i 've already talked to them about our situation with emma , and they said they 'll do whatever we need to make us feel
okay .
i mean , i 'll fly back and forth , they 'll fly you out anything we want .
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .
all right , we 'll work it out .
thank you thank you
yeah , yeah you sure this is what you want ?
i think it is .
ooh , what 's going on ?
i got a really incredible job offer .
hey , great all right
good for you
it 's in paris .
what ? no , no , no no , no no no , no no , too much is changing , okay ? first , phoebe getting married congratulations and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs
hey , this afternoon you said you 'd be supportive
well , it comes and goes . i wouldn 't trust it .
look , you guys this is really , really important to me . and it means a lot if you could try to get on board .
of course we can . congratulations . yay joey
no , no , no . my hugs are reserved for people staying in america .
joey , it would mean so
hey no get your france-going-arms away from me .
joey
you okay with this ?
well , it makes me feel sad , but
talking to ross .
i see .
well , rachel moving to another country ? not being able to see her every day . how can i be okay with this ?
i know , but what are we gonna do ? she really needs this job .
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back , she would take it ?
how is that gonna happen ?
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?
i don 't know . i could talk to her boss . yeah i met him at that christmas party . we really hit it off .
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ?
i didn 't say we were brothers .

hey phoebe . hey , tell me what you think . all right . the house next door to the one that we 're buying in westchester ? just went on the market . i wanna take a look at it , but chandler doesn 't .
we close escrow tomorrow , so seeing another house can only confuse us , and we 're easily confused . we 're not very bright .
but what if it is better than ours ? should we at least look ?
what do you think pheebs ?
well , i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins anyway hey , isn 't joey 's agent estelle leonard ?
yeah .
she died .
you 're kidding
that 's terrible
yeah , last saturday . wow she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic . oh , wait a minute , i read the wrong one .
oh yeah ?
yeah , she was just an agent .
joey 's gonna be so upset .
i know . he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .
well , we cannot tell joey about this . he 's already flipping out about everything that 's changing . this will push him over the edge .
seriously , you don 't think we should tell him ?
well , not for a little while . let 's just give him a few days to get used to everything else .
what if he reads it in the paper ?
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we 're okay .

yeah , i 'm a friend of rachel green 's . uhm , actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago .
oh right , uhm , don ?
close . ron .
uh what can i do for you ?
uhm , well i 'm here to see if you 'll give rachel her job back .
ah , did she ask you to come here and do this ?
oh , no . at first i have to get you to agree . then we 'll see if she wants to come back .
wow , that is tempting .
look , she loved her job here . and let 's face it you 're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it . isn 't that true ?
she is good
huh , i took a shot there .
but i 'm sorry . there 's nothing i can do ah , it 's not true , there is nothing i want to do .
i see thanks very much . is this your son ?
yeah , his name is ross . what ?
oh , nothing , its just , its close to ron . does he does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance ?
yeah , they 're all he talks about , why ?
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left , just the two of us , and he can touch anything he wants . . i just heard it as you must have heard it and thats not good . let me start again . im a paleontologist , youll
you can really arrange that ?
you let rachel come back , and its done .
well , i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world .
yeah yes thank you this is great . thank you so much . and i swear , your kid is going to have the time of his life .
thats great . i worry about little ross . hes always reading , he 's collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs .
hell be fine .

hey phoebe .
hey . everything ok ?
im just mad at my agent .
estelle ? why ?
theres a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didnt even be put up for it shed better have a good reason .
im guessing she does .
well im wanna hear it , because she keeps doing this .
well , no , no , wait , wait , wait . all right , i gotta go . just listen . promise me , that you will wait a minute before you call her .
ok . why ?
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .
i love that saying

hello ?
joey , its estelle .
i was just gonna call you thats weird .
its a little coincidental , but believable . . listen , im sure youre wondering why i didnt get you an audition for that tv movie .
yeah , actually i am
i guess i dropped the ball there . whoopsie
thats it ? you know , it seems all you do lately is drop the ball .
dont take that tone with me . who you think you are ? alan lemond , the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic ?
no , no , look . all im saying is that youre my agent , ok ? and youre not getting me into any auditions and im tired of it .
what are you saying ?
im saying that . this isn 't working for me anymore , ok ? estelle , youre fired . goodbye . .
man , tough week for estelle

hi .
hi .
emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house . you know she cant sleep without it .
oh , well , shes asleep now . stop forcing that thing on her .
ok .
oh , youre not gonna believe what happened to me today ralph lauren called , and gave me my job back
nooo
yee . i mean , it was so weirdest thing . they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back i mean , that place must have been falling apart without me .
so , youre not going to paris .
no , im still going .
wh whwhat ?
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back , the offered me more money isnt that great ?
yeeeah

oh , sure . im showing it to someone else right now , but please , look around .
thanks .
it feels like were cheating on our house . and if were gonna cheat , shouldnt it be with like a hot , younger house , that does stuff that our house wont do ?
ours is so much better this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave what a hole
so ? what do you think ?
love it
well , we already have one offer on it , and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .
they could be our neighbors , what are they like ?
oh , the woman upstairs is very nice . she and her husband have two kids , he 's on wall street and she
oh my god

sure .

hey joey , want come with me to are you ok ?
yeah , i just i just feel bad about firing estelle . this is got to be killing her .
no , that wouldnt kill her . ordinary embolism might .
i dont know . shes got to be taking it hard , i was like her only client . except for this guy who eats paper . and im guessing he eats more money than he makes . look , i know shes not a great agent , but she did stick with me for ten years . im gonna
no , no , no don 't call her you wait for her to call you
why ?
because patience is the road to understanding which is the key to a happy heart .
you blow me away .
all right , so promise you 're gonna wait for her to call you ?
i promise . and that means , never having to give a reason .

and yet i never run into beyonce
you two know each other ?
oh , we go way back . before monica made an honest man out of him , chandler used to be my little love muffin . so ? are you guys thinking of getting this house too ? ooh are we gonna have a bidding war ? i 'd better warn you , i 'm a toughie
don 't , don 't
no , actually , we 're buying the house next door .
why ?
i d on 't know why .
ooh , that decides it then . i was on the fence . but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ? ah now we have to get it ellen , we 're going to talk numbers .
this can not be happening
okay , the realtor said another couple made an offer . maybe the janice 's won 't get it maybe the other couple will .
the only way that that is going to happen , is if the other couple are the hitlers .
okay , okay , all right . what if we got both houses ? huh ? we can turn this house into a guest house .
that is a great idea and by the way , i don 't mean to sound distasteful , but when did you start crapping money ?
okay , you come up with an idea .
alright alright , we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house . we can still get out .
but we love our house .
will we love it so much with her next door ? and she 's gonna be louder out here too . just the crickets and oh my god
okay , but if we don 't get this house , she 's stil gonna show up wherever we go i mean , at least if she 's here , it eliminates the element of suprise . i mean , never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body
well , we have to do something . we can 't have her living next door . oh , that does it too .

who is it ?
it 's me . ron . look , i um , i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back .
this may surprise you , but re-hiring fired employees , is not my main job .
just hear me out . how would you feel about offering her a raise ?
not good , ron .
perhaps i can persuade you . what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica .
wow , that 's pretty cool
huh ? so ? we have a deal ?
okay , you got it .
yes yes
this is gonna make me very popular .
oh , believe me , the ladies , they love it
i meant with my son .
good , cause the ladies , not so much .

oh my god . hello ?
joey , it 's estelle .
estelle ?
yeah , i wanted to call and tell you that there 's no hard feelings for firing me .
ok-ay . i just , i can 't believe you 're calling me ?
well , i didn 't think i should just drop by
no , no , no don 't drop by , don 't drop by
anyway , you did what you had to do . i 'm okay .
can i ask you something ? uhm , what 's it like there ?
it 's alright . look kiddo , i gotta go . good luck with the career . you 're gonna be huge .
thanks for everything estelle . bye . out of area . boy , i 'll say .

the hitlers will be so disappointed .
all right , i got to run . tell monica i say goodbye . and i 'll see you later , neighbor .
wait i just want you to know that i 'm so happy you 're going to be here .
oh , me too
because that way we can pick up where we left off .
huh ?
i never stopped loving you .
oh my
yeah , yeah , yeah i want you i need you i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein .
chandler , what are you talking about ?
now that you live next door , we can be together every day . sid and monica never have to know a thing .
i don 't know what to say i mean , you know , obviously we have this heat between us .
obviously .
but i love my husband . and i know you love your wife . now , i don 't think we should get this house now .
don 't say that . don 't tangle the dream and take it away .
chandler , one of us has got to be strong .
i understand .
although , maybe just one last moment of weakness goodbye chandler bing .
they 're never coming down now .

hi
hey
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .
what ?
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money .
they did ?
yeah . it was the weirdest thing . zelner called me and he said we 'll do everything we can to get you back . and that i should thank some ron i don 't even know what department that guy 's in .

uhm , i hadn 't no you i had no idea you were so excited about paris . uhm , i mean , you said you were scared .

hey .
hey .
hey , where 's rach ?

you know what ? uhm , i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was gonna save it until the end of the night , but come here .
hey , what do you think they 're doing in there ?
huh , if i had to guess i 'd say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching .

oh , pheebs , i don 't even know where to start .
ok well , before you do , i know we weren 't supposed to get you going away presents , but i do have something for you .
oh , oh . . what is this ?
it 's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it , so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there , you can use the dna to create your own pheebs
i 'm gonna throw this away , but thank you so much for the gesture

chandler ? i was just in our bedroom and i found these on my pillow .
oh , yes . i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play
what are you talking about ? these aren 't mine .
oh yeah , right good luck getting another scarf dance from me
that would be a terrible punishment . but , i 'm serious , i 've never seen these before .

rachel used to live in that room .
rachel with handcuffs interesting
joey 's bare ass
. well played .

yeah ?
can you come here with me for a minute ?
sure .
are you wearing waterproof mascara ?
no .
oh , you 're so screwed .
hey . what was that all about ?
she 's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually .
are you kidding ? oh my god
yeah , i know , it 's gonna be even worse for you god ross , get ready to do some serious crying .
oh , man , i 'm not going to be able to handle this . now i know how my students feel at the end of each year . and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations .

mon okay i 've gotta just say what it is i 'm gonna say none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years , would have happened if it wasn 't for you . no-one has been more like a sister to me
i know what you mean . you 're like a sister to me too .
i wouldn 't know what i 'm gonna do without you
you 're the best friend i ever had .

what ?
i i i
that is so sweet .

oh no , she took down monica and i 'm the crier in the family . oh god i could be next . maybe she won 't talk with me if it looks like we 're deep in converstation . oh , so that thing you said about the thing . it really made me think about that other thing
uh , rach ?
well it 's okay . chandler is talking to her .
i really made you think about that thing uh ?
uh , rach i think i have something that belongs to you .
oh , i 'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don 't get .
no , no , no they 're really yours . we found them in your old room .
well , these aren 't mine . maybe monica used to use them with
don 't say richard well , if they 're not monica 's and they 're not yours , then whose are they ?
well , i think you 're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room .
pheebs
yeah
i think these are yours .
these are not mine look how flimsy they are , come on good god you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these , they 'll snap like a piece of licorice .
can i talk to you alone for a minute ?
sure . you don 't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you ?
where do you think mike really is ?

oh honey
let me just say something because once we get into this , i 'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke i just want to say that i i love you and , i 'm gonna miss you . and i 'm so sad that you 're leaving .
oh , you know what ? let 's not say anything else . i love you .
ooh , not so tight i 'm sorry , just give me one more chance .
okay . oh

oh
i 'm sor just go . just go . i can 't , i can 't .

so , i guess you 're next . you 're ready ?
i don 't think so .
oh , you 're definately not . i haven 't cried like that in years .
you cried yesterday at the six o 'clock news .
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .
god i can 't believe she saved me for last . why are they taking so long ?
i don 't know . but , god , joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well .

no , no , no , no

okay , here we go
oh well
yeah
i think i 'm gonna take off .
huh ?
oh , you guys . this was an amazing night . thank you so much . i love you . good night .

what ? i don 't get a goodbye ?
lucky bastard

unbelievable . she says goodbye to everyone but me .
well , maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be , you know , implicit .
well , it needs to be plicit .
all right , let 's think about this . i mean , there 's got to be an explanation . uh did you do anything to make her mad ?
no , i don 't think so .
you know , maybe she was just really spent from our talk . it was pretty intense .
yeah . mine too .
mine was a humdinger
o-kay i mean , don 't i deserve anything ? i mean , a few tears , a cursory hug ? not from you
ross , if you 're this upset , you should go and talk to her .
and say what ? you owe me a goodbye , i mean , he 's got more pride than that .
the hell i do

i don 't get a goodbye ?
what ?
everyone gets a goodbye but me ? what have i got to do to get a goodbye , huh ? be best friends with you ? uh , go out with you ? have a baby with you ? oh wait a minute , wait a minute , i did all those things .
ross
oh no , maybe it 's me , i 'm just not giving you enough credit . uh , i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people . uh , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , good it 's physically impossible . you know what ? after all we 've been through , i can

i hope ross isn 't too upset .
i 'm sure he 's not more bummed out than i am .
tell me about it .
well , you can 't say we don 't know how to throw a party .
all right , i think i 'm gonna head out .
uh , where do you think you 're going ?
i thought i was going home to go to bed , but i 'm sensing there 's something less fun for me to do here .
we 're moving in a couple of days and we 've got a lot of packing to do . it would be great if you guys could pitch in .
joey and i can finish up in the guest room .
oh , yeah , yeah , good idea .
oh no you and phoebe are gonna help me in here .
you couldn 't be cool .
okay , we 're gonna start in the kitchen . plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box . the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped . got it ?
yeah .
good now i need you to be careful and efficient . and remember , if i am harsh with you , it is only because you are doing it wrong .
hey mon , i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .
you did ? how ?
well , i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them being used .
oh my god let me see .
who 's that dirty old lady ?
monica 's grandmother .
nana liked it rough

hi
hey
come on here , have a seat .
how was your night ?
oh , it was okay . i went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner . we went to this place that had ooh hoo ooh anyway , they had these really amazing cheeseburgers .
erica , are you okay ?
yeah , you know , maybe i ate too much . i keep getting these stomach aches . they come and go like every few minutes .
oh my god

she doesn 't have a stomach ache , she 's in labor .
oh my god
yeah , you got to get to the hospital .
all right , chandler get the coats . erica let 's go . phoebe and joey , keep packing oh my god we 're gonna have a baby . all right . we 're gonna have a baby oh my god , we 're gonna have a baby oh god , oh god , i got to sit down ,

ooh are you sure ?
oh yes , i 'm sure . oh honey , let 's go . okay bye everyone .

chandler , wait , wait , wait
what ?
if you get a second , find out where she got that cheeseburger .

you really think i didn 't say goodbye to you because i don 't care ?
that 's what it seemed like .
i cannot believe that after ten years , you do not know one thing about me .
fine , then why didn 't you say something ?
because it is too damn hard ross . i can 't even begin to explain to you how much i 'm gonna miss you . when i think about not seeing you every day , it makes me not want to go okay , so if you think that i didn 't say goodbye to you because you don 't
rach
what ?
you keep , you keep you can 't
what ?

a little more .
okay .
a little more , a little more . a little more all right . okay , all right , let 's do this .
all right , ready ?
yeah . all right , now give me your best shot .
all right , here it goes

doesn 't work

previously on friends .
erica , are you okay ?
yeah , you know , maybe i ate too much . i keep getting these stomach-aches . they come and go like every few minutes .
oh my god
relax we 'll just get her some antacids .
she doesn 't have a stomach-ache . she 's in labor
oh my god

so if you think i didn 't say goodbye to you because you don 't mean as much to me as everybody else , you 're wrong . it 's because you mean more to me .
rach
what ?

hey .
shh go back to sleep . i have to go home .
oh . this was amazing .
it really was . you 've learned some new moves
yeah , well , this guy at work gave me sex for dummies as a joke .
ah .
who 's laughing now ?
i know

breathe , breathe , breathe good .
next time , can i say breathe ?
no , last time you said it like dracula , and it scared her can i get you anything ? you want some more ice chips ?
no , i 'm okay .
alright , i 'll be right back .
where are you going ?
to use the bathroom .
you can 't leave me alone with her .
what ?
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?
it 's just that we 've never spent any time , you know , alone together .
you 'll be fine . nah , you won 't , but i 'll be back in two minutes .
okay .

so , ah any plans for the summer ?
i don 't know . maybe church-camp ?
hah . may not wanna mention this . so , you ever wonder which is worse , you know going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?
what ?
well , it 's just interesting . you know , because no one will ever know , because no one can experience both .

one of life 's great , unanswerable questions . i mean , who knows ? maybe there 's something even more painful than those things ? like this .

morning .
hey
what 's that ?
it 's my house-warming present for monica and chandler .
it 's a baby chick and duck
uh-huh . and i named them chick jr. and duck jr .
i did not see that coming .
yeah , i figure they 'll love it at the new house , you know ? it has that big backyard . and then , when they get old , they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to .
yes .
yeah . it 's a shame people can 't visit there .
that is the rule , though .

guess what ? you 're almost an uncle
what ?
yeah , erica went into labor last night . monica and chandler are at the hospital right now
oh my god
yeah , and i have a definite feeling it 's gonna be a girl .
phoebe , you were sure ben was gonna be a girl .
have you seen him throw a ball ?
is rachel here ?
uh , i think she 's still asleep . hey , hey , how did it go with you guys last night ? she seemed pretty pissed at you .
uh , we , y 'know , we worked things out .
what 's that smile ? did something happen with you two ?
hey , i 'm not one to kiss and tell , but i 'm also not one to have sex and shut up . we totally did it
oh my god . you and rachel ?
i know , it 's pretty great .
so what does that mean ? are you guys getting back together ?
oh , i i don 't know . we didn 't really get to talk .
but do you wanna get back together ?
i don 't know . it was incredible . i mean , it just felt so right . when i was holding her , i mean , i never wanted to let her go . you know what ? yeah , i do . i wanna be together .
yay

so , so is she still going to paris ?
wow , i hadn 't thought of that . i hope not .
oh , this is like the best day ever . ever you guys might get back together , monica and chandler are getting their baby , there are chicks and ducks in the world again oh , i feel like i 'm in a musical daa raa when the sun comes up , bright and beaming and the moon comes

so

morning .
you too . last night was just wonderful .
it really was .
i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face .
i know , me too . it was you know , it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen , and then it does , and it 's everything you want it to be .
uh-huh . i know . it was just , it was just the perfect way to say goodbye .

it 's just a little bit more , honey .
help me this hurts
is it really that bad ?
uh-huh i think it 's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse

the baby 's head is crowning .

oh oh my god that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen chandler , you have to see this

oh , yeah these are the faces of two people in the know

i can 't believe you didn 't know it 's twins this has never happened before .
well , gosh . that makes me feel so special and good .
wait , did you know it was twins ?
yeah , it 's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .
anybody tell you ?
i don 't think so . although , they did mention something about two heartbeats . but i thought that was just mine and the baby 's . they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong , and i thought well , that 's good cause i 'm having a baby .
this is unbelievable .
twins actually run in my family .
interesting can i see you for a second ?

what do we do ?
what do you mean what do we do ?
twins twins
chandler , you 're panicking
uh-huh join me , won 't you ? okay , what do you say we keep one , and then just like have an option on the other one ?
we can 't split them up
why not ? we could give each of them half a medallion , and then years later , they 'll find each other and be reunited . i mean , that 's a great day for everybody .
okay , what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?
what if they 're not ? what if it 's adopted by a king ?
yeah , because i hear the king is looking to adopt .
monica , we are not ready to have two babies
that doesn 't matter we have waited so long for this . i don 't care if it 's two babies . i don 't care if it 's three babies i don 't care if the entire cast of eight is enough comes out of there we are taking them home , because they are our children
okay . shhh

okay .
okay
okay
it looks like we 're about ready over here .

come on , erica , start pushing again now .
ow

here she comes
she ? it 's a girl ?
yeah .
well , now we have one of each and that 's enough

and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .
oh my god what did you say ?
nothing what do you say to that ?
ross , you 've got to tell her how you feel
no way
you can 't just give up is that what a dinosaur would do ?
what ?
dude , i 'm just trying to speak your language .
ross , rachel doesn 't know that you wanna get back together . if she did , she might feel differently . she might not even go .
you really think so ?
i 'm telling you oh , okay this is the part of the musical where there 'd be a really good convincing song . bam-bam , don 't take no for an answer . bam-bam , don 't let love fly away . bam-bam-bam-bam

hi
can 't a girl finish a song around here ?
hey
hi so i just dropped emma off at my mom 's .
okay .
oh , you 're not taking her with you tonight ?
no , we decided that i would go ahead and set up first , and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday .
wow , eight hour flight with a one-year old ? good luck , mom .
are you kidding ? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins ? good luck , emma

alright , you know what ? you 're right . i should at least tell her how i feel .

ross , wait
what ? what ?
could you get me a muffin ?

rachel ?

i i know you 're leaving tonight , but i just have to tell you . i love you .

i i don 't know if that changes your plans at all , but i thought you should know .
gunther oh i love you too . probably not in the same way , but i do . and , and when i 'm in a caf , having coffee , or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun , i 'll think of you . aw .

oh bye guys .

oh my god
unbelievable
hey , you know what might help ?
i 'm not getting you a muffin

do you think they recognize each other from in there ?
maybe . unless they 're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years , and then one day they 're pushed through a vagina and they meet .
we 're going to take erica to recovery now .
there 's something that we wanna tell you . we decided to name the girl-baby erica .
