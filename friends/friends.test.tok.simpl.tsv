0320_234	chandler	nooo she  s really dull and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye
0320_235	rachel	i don  t care i don  t care you are going to have to take her out again and end it , and end it in way that she knows it  s actually ended . and , i don  t care how hard it is for you , do not tell her that you will call

0515_245	chandler	no , the best reason to get married is pregnancy . sorry is pretty much fourth y 'know , behind being ready and actually wanting to get married . will you be my wife ?
0515_246	monica	chandler , umm , i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds .
0515_247	chandler	yeah , i 'm kinda wishing everyone wasn 't here right now .

0515_257	monica	oh my god , what would have done if i said yes ?
0515_258	chandler	well i would 've been happy because i would 've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love . or , you would 've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door .

0515_268	chandler	okay , how long is this going to go on .

0624_384	monica	so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday , you dont really believe that do you ?
0624_385	chandler	sure i do . in fact , i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural . i mean look at pigs . lets take a second here and look at pigs . okay pigs dont mate for life . i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime , and thats just an ordinary
0624_386	monica	yeah , but thats pigs not people
0624_387	chandler	if marriage worked , id be all for it . but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ? 97 .
0624_388	monica	wait a minute . are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married ?
0624_389	chandler	well , never say never but yknow probably uh yeah , never .
0624_390	monica	oh my god then-then-then what are we even doing ? what is this ?
0624_391	chandler	whoa whoa whoa what is all this pressure ? is this some new kind of strategy ? why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap ?
0624_392	monica	yknow what ? i gotta go ugh

0624_396	rachel	were gonna find love
0624_397	phoebe	definitely
0624_398	rachel	yeah , im pretty confident about that . thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80 happy for monica and chandler it would be nice to have a little guarantee though .
0624_399	phoebe	what do you mean ?
0624_400	rachel	well yknow , some people make deals with a friend , like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40 , they marry each other .
0624_401	phoebe	you mean a backup ?
0624_402	rachel	exactly
0624_403	phoebe	yeah , yeah i got that .

0921_007	ross	why do you care so much ?
0921_008	monica	yes rachel , why do you care so much ?
0921_009	rachel	be-cause ross is the father of my child you know and i want him to hook up with lots of women i just all i 'm saying is i don 't think that joey and charlie have anything in common .
0921_010	ross	oh , i don 't know , they seem to have a shared interest in each other 's tonsils
0921_011	phoebe	wow , joey and a professor can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey 's raw sexual magnetism oh , those nerds will get laaaaaid

0921_022	joey	yeah she is cool , and she 's so smart her mind is totally acrimonious . that 's not how she used it ?
0921_023	charlie	i feel like i owe you an explanation . i don 't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties . i 'm well , i 'm kind of embarrassed . i really hope you don 't think less of me .
0921_024	ross	uhm no think less of you no , i don 't think less of you . i mean , you saw someone you liked and you kissed them . i mean , those people who like someone and don 't kiss them those-those people are stupid , i hate those people .
0921_025	charlie	you know , actually i 'm a little surprised to myself . i mean , joey is so different from the guys i usually date . i mean , they 're all professors , and intellectuals , and paleontologists mostly , you know , very cerebral
0921_026	ross	yeah , i know the type .
0921_027	joey	hey , if you wanna grab a bite before work we 'd better get acrimonious . no ? am i getting close ?

0921_193	joey	note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas . monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself .
0921_194	ross	now , do you have any idea what you just said ?
0921_195	joey	no , no , my mouth says the words , my brain is thinking monster trucks
0921_196	ross	ok now , remember , when you get to the museum , monet is not spelt m-o-n-a-y . i just i wrote that out phonetically for you .
0921_197	joey	phonetically ?
0921_198	ross	yeah , yeah that means you know ? we just we don 't have time for this .
0921_199	joey	ok .
0921_200	ross	ok , but you know what ? i gotta say , i 'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly
0921_201	joey	ah i 'm an actor i can memorize anything last week on days i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy .
0921_202	ross	wow . what does that mean ?
0921_203	joey	no idea but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means you 're gonna get eaten by a bear .
0921_204	ross	ok so let 's move on to the renaissance ?
0921_205	joey	ok , caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure . touch it , it 's really bumpy .

0921_211	janice	oh sid is still in his room . i don 't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him . so did you do it ? did you make your deposit ?
0921_212	chandler	yeah yeah the hard part is over
0921_213	janice	that 's not the hard part honey the hard part is what comes next , i mean aren 't you worried about the results ?
0921_214	chandler	i haven 't i haven 't even thought about the results yet i just assumed that everything was gonna be ok .
0921_215	janice	oh well , you know what ? it probably is .
0921_216	chandler	yeah , but what if it 's not ? what if there is a reason why we can 't have a baby ?
0921_217	janice	oh , chandler , look . you and monica are meant to have children . i am sure it 's gonna be just fine .
0921_218	chandler	oh , oh , yeah , ok , thanks . i can 't believe i didn 't even think of that . i guess i was just so worried about having to come here and do that
0921_219	janice	what , you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell , but you can 't do it at a doctor 's office ?
0921_220	chandler	it was a wendy 's

0921_222	phoebe	ipan stripan , glupi glabi and that is the swedish national anthem thank you for asking
0921_223	rachel	wow , ikea what a rich culture . uhm , you know what ? i have a friend who is a masseuse .
0921_224	phoebe	oh , ja ja
0921_225	rachel	yah she 's uhm not very good though
0921_226	phoebe	uhu , uhu and why do you think that is ?
0921_227	rachel	i don 't know maybe it 's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar
0921_228	phoebe	or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you 're such a high maintenance tight ass
0921_229	rachel	phoebe
0921_230	phoebe	you know it 's me ?
0921_231	rachel	for like a half an hour man , you can lie about sweden
0921_232	phoebe	how can you come here ?
0921_233	rachel	how could you not tell me you worked here ?
0921_234	phoebe	i don 't have to tell you everything
0921_235	rachel	yes you do , if you 're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage
0921_236	phoebe	tips not included .
0921_237	rachel	oh phoebe , why did you lie to me about working here ?
0921_238	phoebe	because i was ashamed ok ? i sold out for the cash and then they give me benefits like medical , and dental , and a 401k . but you know you pay a price . now i 'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh paying taxes
0921_239	rachel	phoebe , honey , if you hate it so much , you should walk out there right now and quit be true to what you believe in honey , you have principles and i so admire that i don 't have any
0921_240	phoebe	you know what ? you are right . i am gonna quit . it 's time i took my life back
0921_241	rachel	good for you pheebs
0921_242	phoebe	ok .
0921_243	phoebe	okay if you guys have microphones in there too , i didn 't mean any of that . i love you .

0921_245	ross	haha got ya die , die , die

0921_247	ross	respectfully , professor r. geller . hey
0921_248	charlie	hi
0921_249	ross	hey , how was the met ?
0921_250	charlie	the museum was amazing
0921_251	ross	yeah ? joey really knows his art , huh ?
0921_252	charlie	not so much , no . he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say , and some of it didn 't even make any sense .
0921_253	ross	what do you mean ?
0921_254	charlie	well , for one , he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .
0921_255	ross	wait a minute when you guys walked into the met , did you go to the right ?
0921_256	charlie	no , we went to the left .
0921_257	ross	oh joey , joey but still , i mean , it seems like you guys are having a great time together .
0921_258	charlie	yeah , it 's fun .
0921_259	ross	what ?
0921_260	charlie	actually , you know , joey is your friend , and you don 't really know me that well it would be weird .
0921_261	ross	what , i mean , a little , but no , what , go on .
0921_262	charlie	well i 'm just thinking that maybe he 's not the right guy to be with right now , maybe i should be with someone i have more in common with . you know what i mean ?
0921_263	ross	yeah . but you know what ? i think you should give joey a chance . i mean , he 's a great guy , and sure he doesn 't know that much about art but you know , you can always talk about that with someone else .
0921_264	charlie	yeah , i guess that 's true .
0921_265	ross	and if you think about it , i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you . you know , that 's the kind of guy joey is .
0921_266	charlie	he is very sweet . plus he 's hot
0921_267	ross	that was going to be my next argument .

0921_269	joey	hey
0921_270	ross	hey
0921_271	charlie	hey
0921_272	joey	you 're ready ?

0921_285	chandler	actually it 's both of us .
0921_286	monica	what ?
0921_287	chandler	apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment .
0921_288	monica	oh what does that mean ?
0921_289	chandler	it means that my guys won 't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do . it means
0921_290	monica	chandler ?
0921_291	chandler	it means that we can keep trying , but there 's a good chance this may never happen for us .

0922_039	monica	hi .

0922_041	monica	ok .
0922_042	doctor connelly	above all , even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren 't great , you never know so , keep having sex on a regular basis .

0922_045	monica	don 't worry , after a while he 'll tune it out .
0922_046	doctor connelly	ok , given your situation , the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy , or insemination using a sperm donor .
0922_047	monica	ok .
0922_048	doctor connelly	and , of course , if you feel that neither of those is right for you , you can always adopt .
0922_049	chandler	is that a hint ? because we love you doctor connelly but we don 't think we 'd want you to be our child wow , talking about an inhospitable environment

0922_064	ross	yeah , well i think i know how to dazzle him .
0922_065	rachel	oh you 're not gonna do a magic trick , are ya ?
0922_066	ross	tsz no .

0922_070	ross	it 's in barbados .
0922_071	chandler	but you come first
0922_072	rachel	i 'm there

0922_075	rachel	bye , see ya .
0922_076	chandler	ok .
0922_077	joey	all right , so . how did it go at the fertility clinic ?
0922_078	chandler	not as much fun as last time . apparently you only get porn if you 're giving a sperm sample .
0922_079	ross	so-so what did the doctor say ?
0922_080	chandler	well there 's surrogacy , but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child , she has felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her .
0922_081	joey	so you 're ruling out surrogacy ?
0922_082	chandler	yeah .
0922_083	joey	so , i don 't have to learn what that means ?
0922_084	chandler	aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination , so we 're talking about sperm donors .
0922_085	joey	enough said , i 'm there for you man . where is she , upstairs ?
0922_086	chandler	ah-ha
0922_087	ross	how do you feel about all this ?
0922_088	chandler	i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don 't think there is one .
0922_089	joey	come on ross , be a good guy . step up and do it
0922_090	ross	what ?

0922_092	ross	what ? no i am not going to give them ben

0922_094	ross	the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are are staggering .
0922_095	professor sherman	mmm-mm .
0922_096	ross	i mean , we 've been accepting leakey 's dates as a given , but if they 're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions , you know , right in the trash . so-so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions

0922_098	ross	oh , that 's not what you want

0922_100	shop assistant	incentive for men ?
0922_101	phoebe	oh , i 'll take some of that .

0922_120	phoebe	so what were you doing out there , do you not like charlie ?
0922_121	rachel	she 's ok , i just don 't get a really good vibe from her
0922_122	phoebe	why ?
0922_123	rachel	i don 't know , you know , just the way she waltzed in here all smart , and tall you know , and just swept joey off his feet i mean , nobody else has a chance

0922_130	phoebe	uh , wow isn 't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ?
0922_131	rachel	oh , i get it
0922_132	phoebe	oh well , as long as it is under control , you know , you can 't do anything about it , he 's already dating her , and she is a nice person , that wouldn 't be right .
0922_133	rachel	i know , i know , so it is just not a big deal .
0922_134	phoebe	yeah .
0922_135	rachel	so can we keep this between us ?
0922_136	phoebe	sure
0922_137	rachel	ok , great , because i gotta get out of here , the smell of beets is killing me

0922_155	chandler	no , i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him i mean , if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy , get to check him out .
0922_156	monica	chandler
0922_157	chandler	i 'm telling you , he 's great i mean , even if my sperm worked fine , i 'd think he 'd be the way to go

0922_302	monica	does seem pretty perfect .
0922_303	chandler	yeah , you think so , well ? should i ask him ?
0922_304	monica	no .
0922_305	chandler	why not , just because his great-grandmother was obese , our kids are gonna get that from you anyway
0922_306	monica	no , that 's not it . it 's just that when we were asking him all those questions before , i just i just realized i don 't care if he 's the most perfect guy in the world he 's not you .
0922_307	chandler	yeah , he 's better
0922_308	monica	no , he 's not . and if i can 't get pregnant with you , then i don 't want to get pregnant by him or anyone else .
0922_309	chandler	really ? are you sure ?
0922_310	monica	yeah , i 'm sure .
0922_311	chandler	thank god , because i don 't wanna do this either . you know , i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do . you know , i 'm the husband , i 'm supposed to bring the sperm .

0922_313	chandler	so you know this leaves us with
0922_314	monica	adoption .
0922_315	chandler	how do you feel about that ?
0922_316	monica	i think i feel ok about it . actually i think i feel really good about it .
0922_317	chandler	me too . i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you . and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way .
0922_318	monica	so this is it , we 're really gonna adopt ?
0922_319	chandler	yeah .
0922_320	monica	oh my god , we 're gonna be parents
0922_321	chandler	we are gonna be great parents .
0922_322	monica	and it could be soon . i mean , think about it right now , somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived .
0922_323	chandler	wait , if we 're lucky , and we 're really really really quiet , we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking

0922_327	chandler	hey , zack
