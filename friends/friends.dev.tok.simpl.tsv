0518_031	joey	whoa-whoa , but her birthday isn 't like for another month .
0518_032	phoebe	yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday , then it 's not a surprise .
0518_033	monica	i think it 's a great idea . yeah , we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends .
0518_034	joey	ross we 're having a surprise party for rachel
0518_035	ross	okay
0518_036	joey	done .

0518_042	joey	what , so i gotta shut it down now ?
0518_043	ross	all right , i gotta take off . i 'm picking up ben then we 're off to the big audition .
0518_044	monica	it 's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben 's dad .
0518_045	ross	yeah .
0518_046	chandler	weirder than watching his two moms make out ?
0518_047	joey	whoa-whoa dad ? there 's a dad in the commercial ?
0518_048	ross	yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .
0518_049	joey	whoa , hey , maybe i 'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad . i mean who better to play ben 's father than his godfather .
0518_050	ross	you 're not his godfather .
0518_051	joey	what ? are you kidding ?
0518_052	ross	of course i am okay , let 's go godfather .
0518_053	joey	all right

0518_056	joey	hey i 'm in , they 're gonna let me audition
0518_057	ross	really ? that 's great
0518_058	joey	i know i know it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play , so i steered clear of her
0518_059	carol	hey , that kid looks familiar .
0518_060	joey	oh yeah , yeah he 's done tons of commercials . i 've seen him in like sugar smacks , playstation , and that one for the phone company . in fact he was so good in that one , he actually convinced me to switch phone companies . chandler was mad .
0518_061	ross	yeah well , he 's not gonna get this one . ben is way cuter than that kid . i mean look at him , look at you ,
0518_062	joey	that 's great . listen , wouldn 't it be great though if i got to play ben 's dad ?
0518_063	ross	joey , you look nothing like ben .
0518_064	joey	i look more like him than you do
0518_065	carol	y 'know , i don 't really know you well enough for you to do that .

0518_067	kim	so it 's down to these two , nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree . rachel , what do you think ?
0518_068	rachel	well umm , that one is pretty but uh , i just , i just love this fabric sorry .
0518_069	kim	oh don 't be sorry , that 's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them--i 'm kidding .
0518_070	nancy	she is kidding , but don 't ever disagree with her again . okay , now i 'm kidding
0518_071	rachel	oh , what a fun office .
0518_072	kim	i don 't know which one , but i do know i need a cigarette . so what do you say we take a break , we go outside , and we 'll figure this out when we come back ?

0518_074	kim	rachel ? do you smoke ?
0518_075	rachel	oh no , my dad 's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess 's right to smoke .

0518_077	rachel	and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me
0518_078	monica	that doesn 't seem fair .
0518_079	rachel	i know it 's like i 'm being punished for not having this disgusting , poisoning habit
0518_080	chandler	yeah , it is the best .
0518_081	rachel	i mean what if this keeps happening ? y 'know , they 'll-they 'll be outside smoking , making all the decisions and i 'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air , y 'know ? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us , who do you think she
0518_082	monica	rachel , you can go down there , you don 't have to smoke . just say you wanna get some fresh air .
0518_083	rachel	yeah , i can do that .

0907_176	mike	so ? what do you think ?

0907_178	monica	so you stole that tape from richard 's apartment ?
0907_179	chandler	whoho ho listen to the judgement from the porn star
0907_180	monica	that tape was never meant to be seen by joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private .
0907_181	joey	monica , look i don 't think you and i have any secrets anymore not ready to joke about it yet , okay , i see you later .
0907_182	monica	why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?
0907_183	chandler	because that 's who i am , okay ? i 'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn 't bother him . just 'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men 's club over brandy and moustaches .
0907_184	monica	is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?
0907_185	chandler	this is about you and richard . he 's clearly not over you . he keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants .
0907_186	monica	isn 't that sad ? i mean , can you see how pathetic that is ? you shouldn 't be jealous . you should feel bad for him .
0907_187	chandler	oh , yeah , well , poor richard . y i can grow a moustache
0907_188	monica	chandler , this is not our problem . we 've got each other . that 's all that matters .
0907_189	chandler	yeah , oh , but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air
0907_190	monica	cowboy boots ? i 've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life
0907_191	chandler	oh , good , good . play more , cause i wanna see how it ends .
0907_192	monica	that 's not me
0907_193	chandler	what ? that 's not you life is good again ride em cowgirl
0907_194	monica	that bastard taped over me
0907_195	chandler	is that a problem ?
0907_196	monica	i-it 's just so insulting big spring for a new blank tape , doctor

0907_198	theodore	i can 't imagine what he sees in her .
0907_199	bitsy	she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his . oh , hello dear
0907_200	mike	hey , what 's going on ?
0907_201	bitsy	we were just chit-chatting . how 's your friend ?
0907_202	mike	a little better .
0907_203	bitsy	by the way , do you know who 's moving back into town ? tom and sue 's daughter jen .
0907_204	theodore	you remember her michael , she 's lovely and well behaved and single .
0907_205	mike	i 'm not interested .
0907_206	bitsy	oh , please darling , let 's be honest . you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one , but let 's be real
0907_207	mike	all right , stop you know , all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her . and maybe that hasn 't been clear all the time , but she did her best . and yeah she 's a little different than you are
0907_208	bitsy	michael , a pimp spit in her mouth
0907_209	mike	so what ? i mean if even i can get past that , it shouldn 't bother you . and you don 't have to like her . you just have to accept the fact that i do . i mean , if you even can 't be civil to the woman i love
0907_210	bitsy	the woman you what ?
0907_211	phoebe	yeah the woman you what ?
0907_212	mike	the woman i love i love you which is probably something i shouldn 't say for the first time in front of my parents and tom and sue who are by the way the most sinfully boring i 've ever met in my life
0907_213	phoebe	i love you too
0907_214	mike	you do ?
0907_215	phoebe	yeah how great is this ?

0907_236	ross	rachel please that is so inappropriate

0916_002	chandler	did you see our bank statement ? can this be right ?
0916_003	monica	i know god . i haven 't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos . what happened to all our money ?
0916_004	chandler	i 'm not sure what they did , but i 'm inclined to blame enron .
0916_005	monica	i guess with you doing the internship , we 're just spending more than we 're bringing in .
0916_006	chandler	maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .
0916_007	monica	oh , but you 're finally doing something that you love i can 't ask you to give that up . though it 'd be nice if the thing that you love was y 'know finding gold .
0916_008	chandler	you know what ? you know what ? i think we 're making too big a deal out of this. ok ? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things . and maybe we start eating out of joey 's refrigerator for a change . you 're
0916_009	monica	ok worse case scenario is we borrow some money from my parents .
0916_010	chandler	no we 're not borrowing money .
0916_011	monica	why not ?
0916_012	chandler	because we don 't do that . we are bings and if there 's one thing my father taught me was well to always knock before going into the pool house but the other thing was never borrow money .
0916_013	monica	wow i had no idea you had this much pride .
0916_014	chandler	that 's right i do and i 'm your man . and i 'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard .

0916_017	mike	i 'm gonna go .
0916_018	phoebe	why ? ?
0916_019	mike	i haven 't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes .

0916_028	phoebe	great ok i 'll go get the tube top .
0916_029	mike	no , no what i mean is , i hate going back to my apartment now and partly because i live above a known crack den but mostly because when i 'm there , it 's just , i really miss you . so do you want to move in together ?

0916_097	joey	i thought you didn 't have secrets from monica .

0916_123	mike	well hey , i wanna ask you about monica 's little groomy joke .
0916_124	phoebe	oh alright . well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it 's a play on the word roomy .
0916_125	mike	i get the joke . sophisticated as it was . now the thing i wanna say is maybe we should have talked about this before . us living together , you 're not expecting a proposal , right ?
0916_126	phoebe	oh no no no not at all . we 're just moving in right now . see where it goes .
0916_127	mike	yeah well , that 's the thing . for me it 's as far as it can ever go .

0916_130	phoebe	oh . wow .
0916_131	mike	it 's just my first marriage was , you know such a disaster . i kind of lost faith in the whole idea .
0916_132	phoebe	was it really that bad ?
0916_133	mike	at one point near the end she deliberately defecated
0916_134	phoebe	ok , well that 's bad . but don 't you think it might be different with someone else ? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet . except for once in the ocean .
0916_135	mike	look it 's not about who i would marry . and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever . and i was totally wrong
0916_136	phoebe	but it 's just
0916_137	mike	look phoebe , it 's not about you . i just never wanna get married again .
0916_138	phoebe	oh
0916_139	mike	i 'm sorry . are you ok with that ? cause if not maybe us moving in together isn 't the best idea .
0916_140	phoebe	no i definitely don 't wanna get married . no i just wanted to make sure you didn 't want to too . whew coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there 's gonna be hell to pay mister
