0104_001	<scene>	Central Perk, everyone is there except Joey.
0104_002	Monica	 Alright. Phoebe?
0104_003	Phoebe	 Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
0104_004	Ross	 Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
0104_005	Chandler	 Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
0104_006	Rachel	 See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes." (Joey enters.)
0104_007	All	 Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
0104_008	Monica	 Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
0104_009	Joey	 Probably kill myself!
0104_010	Monica	 ..Excuse me?
0104_011	Joey	 Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
0104_012	Ross	 Joey, uh- OM nipotent.
0104_013	Joey	 You are ? Ross, I'm sorry..
0104_015	<scene>	Central Perk, Ross and Monica are watching Phoebe sleep.
0104_016	Monica	 How does she do that?
0104_017	Ross	 I cannot sleep in a public place.
0104_018	Monica	 Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
0104_019	Phoebe	 (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
0104_020	Ross	 It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
0104_021	Monica	 What's going on with you?
0104_022	Phoebe	 I got no sleep last night!
0104_023	Ross	 Why?
0104_024	Phoebe	 My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
0104_025	Monica	 Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
0104_026	Phoebe	 Thanks.
0104_027	<event>	Chandler and Joey enter. Joey is counting his steps.
0104_028	Joey	 ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
0104_029	Chandler	 You got waaaay too much free time.
0104_030	Joey	 (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
0104_031	Chandler	 Happy birthday, pal!
0104_032	Joey	 We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)
0104_033	Ross	 Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
0104_034	Joey	 So?
0104_035	Ross	 So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
0104_036	Chandler	 Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
0104_037	Ross	 Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
0104_038	Monica	 Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
0104_039	Ross	 Ohhh.
0104_040	Joey	 What's wrong with the twentieth?
0104_041	Chandler	 Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
0104_042	Ross	 Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
0104_043	Joey	 The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
0104_044	Chandler	 (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
0104_045	Ross	 What are you doing?
0104_046	Chandler	 (stops) I have no idea.
0104_047	Joey	 C'mon, Ross!
0104_048	Ross	 Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
0104_049	Chandler	 You got it.
0104_050	<event>	Rachel runs up cluching an envelope.
0104_051	Rachel	 Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
0104_052	Phoebe	 I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
0104_053	Monica	 Wow, you worked in a mine?
0104_054	Phoebe	 I worked in a Dairy Queen , why?
0104_055	Rachel	 God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
0104_056	Chandler	 (looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
0104_057	Joey	 Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
0104_058	Ross	 You can totally, totally live on this.
0104_059	Monica	 Yeah, yeah.
0104_060	Ross	 Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
0104_061	All	 Oh! Yeah!
0104_062	<event>	They all get their wallets out and give generous tips.
0104_063	Guys	 Hockey! (They go to leave but are blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne. The guys pause to stare at them.) Hockey! Hockey. (The guys.)
0104_064	Leslie	 (looking around) Rachel?
0104_065	Rachel	 Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.
0104_066	Monica	 (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom .
0104_067	Rachel	 What are you guys doing here?
0104_068	Kiki	 Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!
0104_069	Joanne	 Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
0104_070	Rachel	 (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
0104_071	Leslie	 I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
0104_072	Rachel	 (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
0104_073	Joanne	 Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? (She points to herself and they all scream again.)
0104_074	Kiki	 And while we're on the subject of news.. (She holds up here finger to show off her engagement ring and they all scream again.)
0104_075	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)
0104_076	<scene>	A Street, Chandler and Joey are kicking a can to each other.
0104_077	Chandler	 ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
0104_078	Joey	 Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
0104_079	Chandler	 We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
0104_080	Ross	 Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry.
0104_081	<event>	They walk on. Chandler and Joey start to talk but Ross stops and whines.
0104_082	Joey	 What?
0104_083	Ross	 Peach pit.
0104_084	Chandler	 Yes, Bunny?
0104_085	Ross	 (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
0104_086	Joey	 -Peaches?
0104_087	Ross	 Actually, nectarines, but basically...
0104_088	Chandler	 (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
0104_089	Ross	 Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
0104_090	Joey	 Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
0104_091	<scene>	Central Perk, Rachel, Lesile, Kiki, and Joanne are talking.
0104_092	Rachel	 So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
0104_093	Kiki	 Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
0104_094	Joanne	 Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
0104_095	Rachel	 Okay.
0104_096	Joanne	 When are you coming home?
0104_097	Rachel	 What? Guys, I'm not.
0104_098	Joanne	 C'mon, this is us.
0104_099	Rachel	 I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
0104_100	Kiki	 Waitressing?
0104_101	Rachel	 Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
0104_102	Leslie	 Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
0104_103	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are in pajamas and Monica is making something in the blender as Rachel enters.
0104_104	Monica	 Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
0104_105	Rachel	 What's that?
0104_106	Monica	 Weeeell, it's rum, and-
0104_107	Rachel	 Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
0104_108	Monica	 We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister ... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
0104_109	Phoebe	 Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation ! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
0104_110	Monica	 Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
0104_111	Rachel	 Oh, God, ask them what they want.
0104_112	Monica	 (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
0104_113	Rachel	 But I haven't used my card in weeks!
0104_114	Monica	 That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
0104_115	Rachel	 They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
0104_116	Monica	 (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
0104_117	Rachel	 Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister !
0104_118	<scene>	Madison Square Garden , the guys are trying to find their seats.
0104_119	Ross	 (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
0104_120	Chandler	 What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
0104_121	Ross	 No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
0104_122	Joey	 C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
0104_123	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, they're all hanging out in the living room.
0104_124	Monica	 You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
0104_125	Rachel	 Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
0104_126	Phoebe	 You are just like Jack.
0104_127	Rachel	 ...Jack from downstairs?
0104_128	Phoebe	 No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
0104_129	Monica	 Ah, the other Jack.
0104_130	Phoebe	 Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
0104_131	Rachel	 Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
0104_132	Phoebe	 Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
0104_133	Rachel	 But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
0104_134	Phoebe	 Floopy?
0104_135	Rachel	 Yeah.
0104_136	Monica	 So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
0104_137	Phoebe	 Oh, like that's a word.
0104_138	Rachel	 Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
0104_139	Monica	 ...Pheebs?
0104_140	Phoebe	 Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
0104_141	Rachel	 Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
0104_142	<scene>	Madison Square Garden , the guys are watching the game.
0104_143	Ross	 Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
0104_144	Chandler	 (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
0104_145	Ross	 Pass it! Pass it!
0104_146	Chandler	 He's open!
0104_147	All	 Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
0104_148	<event>	The player shoots and the puck flies off the rink and hits Ross in the face. Chandler looks concered until he notices...
0104_149	Chandler	 Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
0104_150	<event>	Chandler and Joey hold the puck and wave at the TV thing.
0104_152	<scene>	An Emergency Room, Chandler and Joey are leading Ross in.
0104_153	Chandler	 (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
0104_154	Receptionist	 (holds up her handshe is on the phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
0104_155	Chandler	 Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
0104_156	Receptionist	 (on phone) Hold on. (To Chandler) Fill these out, sit over there. (Tosses him some forms.)
0104_157	Ross	 (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented .
0104_158	Receptionist	 Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
0104_159	Joey	 Well, how long do you think it'll be?
0104_160	Receptionist	 (sarcastic) Any minute now.
0104_161	Ross	 Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy...
0104_162	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, the slumber party continues.
0104_163	Rachel	 I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
0104_164	Monica	 No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)
0104_165	Pizza Guy	 (yelling from outside) Pizza guy!
0104_166	Rachel	 Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door.)
0104_167	Monica	 Phoebe?
0104_168	Phoebe	 What?
0104_169	Monica	 Do you have a plan?
0104_170	Phoebe	 I don't even have a 'pl'.
0104_171	Pizza Guy	 Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
0104_172	Rachel	 (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
0104_173	Pizza Guy	 Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
0104_174	Monica	 (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
0104_175	Pizza Guy	 Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
0104_176	Monica	 Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
0104_177	Pizza Guy	 Yeah, that sounds about right.
0104_178	Monica	 Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
0104_179	Phoebe	 And-and a power tie?
0104_180	Pizza Guy	 No, pretty much just a towel.
0104_181	Monica	 (staggered) Oh God.
0104_182	Pizza Guy	 So you guys want me to take this back?
0104_183	Monica	 Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
0104_184	Rachel	 Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
0104_185	Phoebe	 Big Bird's friend.
0104_186	Monica	 I see pizza!
0104_187	Phoebe	 Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)
0104_188	Rachel	 Hello? Who are we spying on?
0104_189	Monica	 White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
0104_190	Rachel	 Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
0104_191	Phoebe	 Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
0104_192	Monica	 Please tell me it's his mother.
0104_193	Phoebe	 Definitely not his mother.
0104_194	Monica	 Oh, no...
0104_195	Phoebe	 Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
0104_196	<scene>	The Emergency Room, Joey is miming hockey pucks kitting foreheads. Chandler realises it's getting tense and goes to the receptionist again.
0104_197	Chandler	 Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
0104_198	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, the girls are all out on the balcony.
0104_199	Monica	 Light still out?
0104_200	Rachel	 Yeah.
0104_201	Monica	 Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
0104_202	Rachel	 Oh please, they're having sex.
0104_203	Monica And Phoebe	 Shut up!
0104_204	Rachel	 So, whaddya think George is like?
0104_205	Monica	 I think he's shy.
0104_206	Phoebe	 Yeah?
0104_207	Monica	 Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
0104_208	<scene>	The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about his first night with Carol.
0104_209	Ross	 I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
0104_210	Chandler	 Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
0104_211	Joey	 He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
0104_212	Ross	 Look, it's just a little more complicated...
0104_213	Chandler	 Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
0104_214	Ross	 Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
0104_215	Chandler	 Then what?
0104_216	Ross	 My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)
0104_217	Joey	 What?
0104_218	Ross	 It was my first time .
0104_219	Joey	 With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
0104_220	Chandler	 So in your whole life, you've only been with one(He gets a look too)oh.
0104_221	Joey	 Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
0104_222	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the balcony.
0104_223	Monica	 Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
0104_224	Phoebe	 Uh-huh.
0104_225	Monica	 Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
0104_226	Phoebe	 Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
0104_227	Monica	 What?! You slept with Jason?
0104_228	Phoebe	 You'd already broken up.
0104_229	Rachel	 How long?
0104_230	Phoebe	 A couple hours.
0104_231	Monica	 Oh, that's nice!
0104_232	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
0104_233	Monica	 Excuse me?!
0104_234	Rachel	 Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl .
0104_235	Monica	 Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
0104_236	Rachel	 I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
0104_237	Phoebe	 There he is! There he is!
0104_238	Monica	 Where?
0104_239	Phoebe	 Right- where we've been looking all night!
0104_240	Rachel	 He is so cute!
0104_241	Monica	 Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
0104_242	All	 Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the(pause)wowww.
0104_243	<scene>	The Emergency Room, Ross is absent.
0104_244	Joey	 Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
0104_245	Chandler	 I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
0104_246	Joey	 Really?
0104_247	Chandler	 No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
0104_248	Both	 Hey, buddy.
0104_249	Ross	 Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose. He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
0104_250	Receptionist	 (sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.
0104_251	Chandler	 Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
0104_252	Ross	 Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
0104_253	Joey	 Oh, ah- the kid has it.
0104_254	Ross	 The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
0104_255	Kid	 I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)
0104_256	Chandler	 You gotta do it, man.
0104_257	Ross	 (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever(to Chandler)can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
0104_258	Kid	 No.
0104_259	Ross	 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
0104_260	Kid	 No! No! (They start to fight over it.)
0104_261	Receptionist	 Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
0104_262	Ross	 (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
0104_263	Ross	 ...Now that was fun.
0104_265	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing twister.
0104_266	Ross	 (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
0104_267	Monica	 Could've played Monopoly , but nooooo.
0104_268	<event>	There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the cushion.
0104_269	Chandler	 Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
0104_270	Ross	 Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)
0104_271	<event>	The phone rings and Chandler answers it.
0104_272	Chandler	 Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
0104_273	Rachel	 Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
0104_274	Chandler	 Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
0104_275	Rachel	 Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
0104_276	Ross	 Green. To the green.
0104_277	Rachel	 (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.
0104_278	Chandler	 To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
0104_279	Rachel	 (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
0120_001	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there.
0120_002	Chandler	 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
0120_003	Joey	 No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
0120_004	Ross	 I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
0120_005	Monica	 (looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
0120_006	Ross	 I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
0120_007	Rachel	 Oh, that is so sick.
0120_008	Chandler	 I feel violated. And not in a good way.
0120_009	Phoebe	 How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
0120_011	<scene>	Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.
0120_012	Chandler	 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
0120_013	Monica	 So have you called her yet?
0120_014	Chandler	 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
0120_015	Joey And Ross	 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
0120_016	Monica	 I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
0120_017	Phoebe	 Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
0120_018	Chandler	 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
0120_019	Joey	 Her answer machine?
0120_020	Chandler	 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
0120_021	Phoebe	 So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
0120_022	Chandler	 Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
0120_023	Monica	 Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
0120_024	Ross	 Okay, okay, what's going on?
0120_025	Phoebe	 Okay, they're just talking...
0120_026	Ross	 Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
0120_027	Phoebe	 No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
0120_028	Ross	 What? What? What?!
0120_029	Phoebe	 That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
0120_030	Chandler	 (bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
0120_031	All	 Oh!... Right!
0120_032	Chandler	 Hey Rach!
0120_033	Monica	 How'd it go?
0120_034	Rachel	 Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room , and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
0120_035	Phoebe	 Not a good day for birds...
0120_036	Rachel	 Then we took a walk down to Bendall's , and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel ...
0120_037	Ross	 That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
0120_038	Rachel	 Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
0120_039	Ross	 That's, that's nice twice!
0120_040	Monica	 Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
0120_041	Joey	 Duh, where've you been?
0120_042	Rachel	 Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
0120_043	<event>	Ross 'prompts' Chandler by hitting him on the arm.
0120_044	Chandler	 Yes!
0120_045	Rachel	 Why?
0120_046	Chandler	 I have my reasons.
0120_047	Monica	 Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
0120_048	Rachel	 All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
0120_049	<scene>	Barry's Office, the post-coital Barry and Rachel are recovering on the chair.
0120_050	Rachel	 Wow... Wow!
0120_051	Barry	 Yeah.
0120_052	Rachel	 I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
0120_053	Barry	 Nooo, it wasn't.
0120_054	Rachel	 Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
0120_055	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there except Rachel.
0120_056	Chandler	 (on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
0120_057	Monica	 That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
0120_058	Chandler	 Hey, I've been honing!
0120_059	Ross	 What was with the dishes?
0120_060	Chandler	 Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
0120_061	Monica	 (looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
0120_062	Phoebe	 Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!
0120_063	Monica	 Great, now he's waving back.
0120_064	Joey	 Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
0120_065	Monica	 What kinda stuff?
0120_066	Joey	 Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
0120_067	Phoebe	 You cook naked?
0120_068	Joey	 Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
0120_069	<event>	A pause as they look at Chandler.
0120_070	Chandler	 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
0120_071	<scene>	Barry's Office, Rachel and Barry are getting dressed.
0120_072	Barry	 What's the matter?
0120_073	Rachel	 Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
0120_074	Barry	 No, it was. It was very very good.
0120_075	Rachel	 Well, what about Mindy?
0120_076	Barry	 Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
0120_077	Rachel	 No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
0120_078	Barry	 Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
0120_079	Rachel	 No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
0120_080	Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
0120_081	Barry	 (into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
0120_082	Rachel	 Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
0120_083	Barry	 We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
0120_084	<event>	Pause as Rachel realises...
0120_085	Rachel	 I had a bra.
0120_086	<event>	Barry finds it draped on a cupboard and gives it to Rachel, they kiss as Bobby enters.
0120_087	Bobby	 Hey, Dr. Farber.
0120_088	<event>	Rachel and Barry quickly split and pretend Barry is examining Rachel's mouth.
0120_089	Barry	 All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
0120_090	<event>	Bobby looks on, deadpan.
0120_091	Rachel	 What?!
0120_092	Bobby	 I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
0120_093	<event>	Rachel glares at him.
0120_094	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters clutching his phone.
0120_095	Chandler	 Can I use your phone?
0120_096	Monica	 Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
0120_097	<event>	Chandler dials his own phone and it rings.
0120_098	Chandler	 Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
0120_099	Joey	 Maybe she never got your message.
0120_100	Phoebe	 Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
0120_101	Chandler	 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
0120_102	Ross	 ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
0120_103	Chandler	 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
0120_104	<event>	He calls and quickly hangs up.
0120_105	Phoebe	 How many beeps?
0120_106	Chandler	 She answered.
0120_107	Monica	 Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
0120_108	Chandler	 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
0120_109	<event>	Rachel enters.
0120_110	All	 Hey! Hi!
0120_111	Phoebe	 How'd he take it?
0120_112	Rachel	 Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
0120_113	Monica	 (wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
0120_114	Rachel	 Oh, do I?
0120_115	Monica	 Uh huh.
0120_116	Rachel	 (in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
0120_117	Monica	 You had sex in his chair ?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
0120_118	Ross	 You-you had what?
0120_119	Phoebe	 Sex in his chair.
0120_120	Ross	 What, uh... what were you thinking?
0120_121	Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
0120_122	Ross	 No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
0120_123	Rachel	 Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
0120_124	<event>	Ross flounders.
0120_125	Chandler	 If it helps, I could slide over.
0120_126	Ross	 It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
0120_127	Phoebe	 Where are you going?
0120_128	Ross	 (leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
0120_129	<event>	Ross exits, a phone rings, and Chandler dives for his phone.
0120_130	Chandler	 Hello? Hello?
0120_131	<event>	Rachel picks up their phone and the ringing stops. As she talks on the phone, an elaborate visual gag is spun out which is too difficult to describe in words.
0120_132	Rachel	 (on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
0120_133	Chandler	 So how's Mindy?
0120_134	Rachel	 Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
0120_136	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, the next morning. Chandler is sitting and staring at his phone. Monica enters and creeps up next to Chandler.
0120_137	Monica	 Brrrrrrr!
0120_138	<event>	Chandler clutches at his phone before realising.
0120_139	Chandler	 Hell is filled with people like you.
0120_140	Joey	 (entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
0120_141	<event>	Rachel enters from her room.
0120_142	Joey	 (ducking) Get down!
0120_143	Rachel	 Get down?
0120_144	Chandler	 ...And boogie!
0120_145	Rachel	 Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
0120_146	Monica	 Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
0120_147	Rachel	 Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
0120_148	Joey	 (intrigued) Yeah?
0120_149	Rachel	 And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
0120_150	Joey	 ..Naughty!
0120_151	Rachel	 Right, I'll see you guys later...
0120_152	Joey	 Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...
0120_153	<event>	Joey exits.
0120_154	Chandler	 Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
0120_155	Monica	 Why don't you just take it with you?
0120_156	Chandler	 Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
0120_157	Monica	 Why don't you just call her?
0120_158	Chandler	 I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
0120_159	Monica	 Do you?
0120_160	Chandler	 No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
0120_161	Monica	 Don't you have to pee?
0120_162	Chandler	 'S'why I'm dancing...
0120_163	<scene>	Central Perk, Rachel is serving coffee as Mindy enters.
0120_164	Rachel	 Mindy.
0120_165	Mindy	 Hey, you.
0120_166	Rachel	 Hey, you.... So, what's up?
0120_167	Mindy	 Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
0120_168	Rachel	 Sure we should... So.
0120_169	Mindy	 Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
0120_170	Rachel	 Okay.
0120_171	Mindy	 Will you be my maid of honour?
0120_172	Rachel	 Of course!
0120_173	Mindy	 Oh that's so great!
0120_174	Rachel	 Was that all you wanted to ask me?
0120_175	Mindy	 That's all!
0120_176	Rachel	 Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
0120_177	Mindy	 That's not all.
0120_178	Rachel	 Oh sure it is!
0120_179	Mindy	 Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
0120_180	Rachel	 Um, what- what would make you think that?
0120_181	Mindy	 Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel .
0120_182	Rachel	 (draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
0120_183	Mindy	 Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
0120_184	Rachel	 What? What's what you were afraid of?
0120_185	Mindy	 Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
0120_186	Rachel	 What?
0120_187	Mindy	 I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
0120_188	Rachel	 Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
0120_189	Mindy	 What do you mean?
0120_190	Rachel	 (offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
0120_191	Mindy	 Oh no.
0120_192	Rachel	 Oh, I am so sorry.
0120_193	Mindy	 No me, I am so sorry...
0120_194	<event>	They hug and Joey enters.

0120_198	Chandler	 Ring dammit, ring!
0120_199	Ross	 Thanks.
0120_200	Joey	 (entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?
0120_201	Chandler	 What?!
0120_202	Joey	 I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
0120_203	Chandler	 (investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
0120_204	Monica	 Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
0120_205	Joey	 Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
0120_206	Chandler	 Nngghhh!!!!!!!
0120_207	Joey	 (to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.

0120_210	Ross	 Five letters.
0120_211	Phoebe	 Rdtor.
0120_212	Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney's a woman.
0120_213	Monica	 So she's a woman! So what?
0120_214	Joey	 Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like(Listens)Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
0120_215	Monica	 Joey!!
0120_216	Joey	 (on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
0120_217	Monica	 The green dress? Really?
0120_218	Joey	 Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
0120_219	Monica	 (waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
0120_220	<scene>	Barry's Office, Barry is preparing his tools alone as Rachel enters.
0120_221	Rachel	 Hey. Got a second?
0120_222	Barry	 Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...
0120_223	Mindy	 Hello, sweetheart.
0120_224	Barry	 Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
0120_225	Rachel	 Uh, we are here to break up with you.
0120_226	Barry	 Both of you?
0120_227	Mindy	 Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
0120_228	Barry	 I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
0120_229	Rachel	 Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
0120_230	Barry	 ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
0120_231	Rachel	 Even when we were having sex in that chair?
0120_232	Barry	 (to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
0120_233	Rachel	 Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
0120_234	Mindy	 (to Rachel) You did it twice?
0120_235	Rachel	 Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
0120_236	Mindy	 Okay...
0120_237	Barry	 (to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
0120_238	Bernice	 (over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
0120_239	Barry	 Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
0120_240	<event>	Barry exits
0120_241	Rachel	 Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great .
0120_242	Mindy	 Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
0120_243	Rachel	 What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
0120_244	Mindy	 Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
0120_245	Rachel	 Oh God.
0120_246	Mindy	 I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
0120_247	Rachel	 And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
0120_248	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.
0120_249	Monica	 You okay?
0120_250	Rachel	 Yeah.
0120_251	Monica	 Really?
0120_252	Rachel	 Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
0120_253	Monica	 Aww... (They hug)
0120_254	<event>	Joey enters and looks on approvingly.
0120_255	Joey	 Big day.
0120_257	<scene>	Central Perk, everyone is there.
0120_258	Joey	 All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
0120_259	Phoebe	 You know he's gay?
0120_260	Ross	 I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
0120_261	Danielle	 (entering) Chandler?
0120_262	Chandler	 Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
0120_263	All	 Hi. Hi.
0120_264	Chandler	 What are you doing here?
0120_265	Danielle	 Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
0120_266	Chandler	 ...I'm, I'm okay.
0120_267	Danielle	 Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
0120_268	Chandler	 That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
0120_269	Danielle	 You got it.
0120_270	Chandler	 Okay.
0120_271	Danielle	 G'bye, everybody.
0120_272	All	 Bye.
0120_273	Phoebe	 Whoo-hoo!
0120_274	Monica	 Yeah, there you go!
0120_275	Ross	 Second date!
0120_276	Chandler	 ...I dunno.
0120_277	Rachel	 You don't know ?!
0120_278	Chandler	 Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
0120_279	<event>	They all groan and hit him..
0203_001	Chandler	 Hey.
0203_002	Monica	 So how was Joan?
0203_003	Chandler	 I broke up with her.
0203_004	Chandler	 They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
0203_005	Rachel	 Come on, they were not that huge.
0203_006	Chandler	 I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
0203_007	Monica	 How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
0203_008	Joey	 Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
0203_009	Chandler	 You or me?
0203_010	Ross	 I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
0203_011	Joey	 You guys are messin' with me, right?
0203_012	All	 Yeah.
0203_013	Joey	 That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
0203_014	Phoebe	 You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
0203_015	Chandler	 Maureen Rosilla.
0203_016	Ross	 Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
0203_017	<event>	knock
0203_018	Monica	 Hello, Mr. Heckles.
0203_019	Mr. Heckles	 You're doing it again.
0203_020	Monica	 We're not doing anything.
0203_021	Mr. Heckles	 You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
0203_022	Rachel	 You don't have birds.
0203_023	Mr. Heckles	 I could have birds.
0203_024	Monica	 Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
0203_025	Mr. Heckles	 Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
0203_026	Rachel	 All right, bye-bye.
0203_027	Chandler	 Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
0203_028	Ross	 We'll give you Janice.
0203_029	Phoebe	 I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
0203_030	Rachel	 "Oh, my, god."
0203_031	Joey	 "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
0203_032	Monica	 Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
0203_033	Rachel	 We won. We won!
0203_034	Monica	 Mr. Heckles.
0203_035	Rachel	 How did this happen?
0203_036	Mr. Treeger	 He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
0203_037	Monica	 That's terrible.
0203_038	Mr. Treeger	 I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
0203_039	Mr. Treeger	 You never know.
0203_040	Phoebe	 Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
0203_041	Chandler	 Ok, Phoebe.
0203_042	Phoebe	 I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
0203_043	Joey	 Such as?
0203_044	Phoebe	 Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
0203_045	Ross	 Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
0203_046	Phoebe	 Nah. Not really.
0203_047	Ross	 You don't believe in evolution?
0203_048	Phoebe	 I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
0203_049	Ross	 Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
0203_050	Phoebe	 Yeah, I just don't buy it.
0203_051	Ross	 Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
0203_052	Phoebe	 Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
0203_053	Ross	 You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
0203_054	Phoebe	 Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
0203_055	<event>	knock
0203_056	Chandler	 Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
0203_057	Mr. Treeger	 There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
0203_058	Monica	 What can we do for you?
0203_059	Mr. Boyle	 All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
0203_060	Monica	 Well, what about his family?
0203_061	Mr. Boyle	 He didn't have any.
0203_062	Rachel	 Ok, so let's talk money.
0203_063	Mr. Boyle	 All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
0203_064	Monica	 I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
0203_065	Rachel	 Have you ever seen so much crap?
0203_066	Chandler	 Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
0203_067	Joey	 Check this out. Can I have this?
0203_068	Ross	 How can you not believe in evolution?
0203_069	Phoebe	 Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
0203_070	Ross	 Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
0203_071	Phoebe	 Really? You can actually see it?
0203_072	Ross	 You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
0203_073	Phoebe	 See, I didn't know that.
0203_074	Ross	 Well, there you go.
0203_075	Phoebe	 Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
0203_076	Chandler	 Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
0203_077	Joey	 Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
0203_078	Chandler	 April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
0203_079	Rachel	 Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
0203_080	Monica	 Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
0203_081	Rachel	 What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
0203_082	Monica	 It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
0203_083	Rachel	 Well, what about my stuff?
0203_084	Monica	 You don't have any stuff.
0203_085	Rachel	 You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
0203_086	Monica	 No.
0203_087	Rachel	 Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
0203_088	Monica	 Mmmmm.
0203_089	Rachel	 Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
0203_090	Ross	 Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
0203_091	Phoebe	 Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
0203_092	Ross	 Please tell me you're joking.
0203_093	Phoebe	 Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
0203_094	Ross	 No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
0203_095	Phoebe	 What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
0203_096	Ross	 Is there blood coming out of my ears?
0203_097	Joey	 Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
0203_098	Chandler	 Wow, he looks so normal.
0203_099	Phoebe	 He's even kind of cute.
0203_100	Joey	 "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
0203_101	Chandler	 Funniest? Heckles?
0203_102	Joey	 That's what it says.
0203_103	Chandler	 Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
0203_104	Phoebe	 I'd call that excessive.
0203_105	Chandler	 Whoa!
0203_106	Joey	 What?
0203_107	Chandler	 Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
0203_108	Joey	 So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
0203_109	Chandler	 I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
0203_110	Joey	 Have you been here all night?
0203_111	Chandler	 Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
0203_112	Joey	 Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
0203_113	Chandler	 Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
0203_114	Joey	 All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
0203_115	Chandler	 What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
0203_116	Joey	 Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
0203_117	Chandler	 How do you know that? How?
0203_118	Joey	 I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
0203_119	Chandler	 You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
0203_120	Joey	 Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
0203_121	Chandler	 Yeah, I understand.
0203_122	Joey	 You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
0203_123	Chandler	 You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
0203_124	Joey	 Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
0203_125	Chandler	 (on phone) Hi, it's me.
0203_126	Janice	 Oh, my, god.
0203_127	Phoebe	 Janice? You called Janice?
0203_128	Chandler	 Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
0203_129	Ross	 You remember Janice, right?
0203_130	Chandler	 Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
0203_131	Janice	 Helloo!!
0203_132	Chandler	 Oh, my, god!
0203_133	Joey	 Geez, look how fat she got.
0203_134	Janice	 Hey, it's everybody.
0203_135	Chandler	 Janice, you're--
0203_136	Janice	 Yes, I am.
0203_137	Chandler	 Is it--?
0203_138	Janice	 Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
0203_139	Chandler	 Congratulations.
0203_140	Janice	 Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
0203_141	Chandler	 You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
0203_142	Janice	 And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
0203_143	Monica	 Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
0203_144	Rachel	 What?
0203_145	Monica	 Hide the Lamp.
0203_146	Rachel	 Monica, let it go.
0203_147	Monica	 Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
0203_148	Rachel	 Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
0203_149	Phoebe	 Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
0203_150	Ross	 Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
0203_151	Phoebe	 Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
0203_152	Ross	 It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
0203_153	Phoebe	 Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
0203_154	Ross	 There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
0203_155	Phoebe	 I can't believe you caved.
0203_156	Ross	 What?
0203_157	Phoebe	 You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
0203_158	Rachel	 I am. Let me just get my coat.
0203_159	Monica	 Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
0203_160	Rachel	 Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
0203_161	Monica	 Phoebe, tell her!
0203_162	Phoebe	 Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
0203_163	Rachel	 Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
0203_164	Chandler	 Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
0203_165	Rachel	 Ok, you win.
0203_166	Monica	 Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
0203_167	Chandler	 Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
0203_168	Phoebe	 Uh huh. Why is that?
0203_169	Chandler	 If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
0203_170	Monica	 You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
0203_171	Chandler	 Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
0203_172	Rachel	 Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
0203_173	Monica	 You are not a freak. You're a guy.
0203_174	Rachel	 She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
0203_175	Monica	 Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
0203_176	Chandler	 In a bad way?
0203_177	Monica	 No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
0203_178	Rachel	 Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
0203_179	Phoebe	 Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
0203_180	Monica	 You made it!
0203_181	Phoebe	 You're there!
0203_182	Rachel	 You are ready to make a commitment!
0203_183	Chandler	 Whoa! Don't know about that.
0203_184	Rachel	 What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
0203_185	Monica	 No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
0203_186	Rachel	 Thank you.
0203_187	Monica	 That's fine.
0203_188	Chandler	 Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
0203_189	Joey	 Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
0203_190	Chandler	 I'll take that.
0203_191	Joey	 You want his yearbook?
0203_192	Chandler	 Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
0203_193	Monica	 Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
0203_194	Rachel	 It's really not that big!
0203_195	Chandler	 Takin' that with you, huh?
0203_196	Joey	 Oh, yeah.
0203_197	Ross	 You comin'?
0203_198	Chandler	 Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
0203_199	Alison	 Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
0203_200	Chandler	 Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)
0318_001	<scene>	Central Perk, all but Chandler are there, Joey laughs for no apparent reason.
0318_002	Monica	 (to Joey) Whats so funny?
0318_003	Joey	 Oh, nothing, no. Its an acting exercise, Im practising my fake laugh.
0318_004	Monica	 Oh. (she laughs)
0318_005	Joey	 What-whats so funny?
0318_006	<event>	Chandler enters with a cigarette.
0318_007	Gunther	 (to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here.
0318_008	Chandler	 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
0318_009	Gunther	 Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
0318_010	Chandler	 Okay.
0318_011	<event>	Chandler hands him the cigarette, and he takes a long drag.
0318_012	Gunther	 Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)
0318_013	Chandler	 No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.
0318_014	<event>	He goes and sits down next to Rachel and puts a cigarette in his mouth, which Rachel takes away from him. He puts another cigarette in his mouth, and Rachel takes it away again.
0318_015	Chandler	 Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.
0318_016	Rachel	 Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
0318_017	Chandler	 Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
0318_018	Rachel	 Come on, its a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasnt smoked since.
0318_019	Ross	 Pffhah.
0318_020	Rachel	 (to Ross) Whats your problem?
0318_021	Ross	 Nothing, its just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
0318_022	Rachel	 Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
0318_023	Ross	 Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
0318_024	Rachel	 Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
0318_025	Phoebe	 All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.

0318_029	Ross	 Here you go.
0318_030	Rachel	 Oh, y'know what, I didnt want cinnamon on this.
0318_031	Ross	 Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)

0318_053	Phoebe	 Yeah, isnt it fantastic?
0318_054	Monica	 Yeah, ah, but Pheebs dont you think hes a little young to get married?
0318_055	Phoebe	 What, hes 18.
0318_056	Ross	 Exactly, itll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
0318_057	Joey	 Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
0318_058	Chandler	 Always illegal Joe.
0318_059	Frank	 (entering with his fiancée Alice, who is obviously much, much older than he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancée, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)
0318_060	Alice	 Y'know it-its funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
0318_061	Phoebe	 Yeah, Im a big surprise.
0318_062	<event>	Ross lets them both sit in his chair.
0318_063	Monica	 So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
0318_064	Frank	 Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knights ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
0318_065	Alice	 And he was my best student.
0318_066	Frank	 Yeah, she was my best teacher.
0318_067	Alice	 Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)
0318_068	Chandler	 If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?
0318_069	Ross	 And so now you guys are gonna be married?
0318_070	Alice	 Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
0318_071	<event>	Both Chandler and Phoebe have shocked looks on their faces.
0318_072	Rachel	 Oh my God!! Great!
0318_073	Phoebe	 Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure youre ready for that?
0318_074	Frank	 I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesnt want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, cause y'know, itll be me. Right?
0318_075	Alice	 Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that theres an age difference between us.
0318_076	Phoebe	 Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didnt.
0318_077	Alice	 Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
0318_078	<event>	They both growl and hiss at each other and then kiss passionately again.
0318_079	<scene>	Chandlers bedroom, Chandler is listening to the hypnosis tape.
0318_080	Hypnosis Tape	 You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You dont need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
0318_081	<scene>	The Moondance Diner, Monica is working, Rachel is having lunch.
0318_082	Monica	 And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
0318_083	Rachel	 Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
0318_084	Monica	 (to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
0318_085	Pete	 Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
0318_086	Monica	 Havent you and I covered that topic?
0318_087	Pete	 Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you .
0318_088	Monica	 Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
0318_089	Pete	 Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
0318_090	Rachel	 (laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
0318_091	Monica	 I mean really, think about it.
0318_092	Pete	 Ho-ho, I will.
0318_093	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are being lectured by Phoebe.
0318_094	Phoebe	 No, I know, I know, that this is Franks life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I dont want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, its sick and wrong!
0318_095	Ross	 Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
0318_096	Phoebe	 No-no, oh, Im fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking its tongue down my little brothers throat!
0318_097	Joey	 Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
0318_098	Phoebe	 But, I mean, do you think hes gonna enjoy it when hes up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-its not fair to the babies, and y'know what, its not good home economics.
0318_099	Joey	 Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
0318_100	Phoebe	 Yes. Not out loud.
0318_101	Ross	 Pheebs, if you dont tell him, soon hes gonna be married, and then youre gonna hate yourself.
0318_102	Phoebe	 Yeah, but if I do tell him, then hes gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I cant. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
0318_103	Ross And Joey	 No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)
0318_104	Phoebe	 Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
0318_105	Ross And Joey	 No.
0318_106	Phoebe	 Okay, Im gonna go get Frank. (exits)
0318_107	Joey	 So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
0318_108	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Monica are entering.
0318_109	Rachel	 I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
0318_110	Monica	 Nah, he doesnt do anything for me.
0318_111	Rachel	 Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger ?
0318_112	Monica	 Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids . (realises) All right, I get your point.
0318_113	Rachel	 All right.
0318_114	Chandler	 (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
0318_115	Monica	 Hey.
0318_116	Chandler	 Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
0318_117	Monica	 Uh, yeah.
0318_118	Rachel	 Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
0318_119	Chandler	 Y'know what, pretty good.
0318_120	Rachel	 Yeah?
0318_121	Chandler	 Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
0318_122	Rachel	 Thank you.
0318_123	Monica	 Here you go.
0318_124	Chandler	 Thanks
0318_125	Rachel	 Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
0318_126	Chandler	 What check thing?
0318_127	Monica	 As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.
0318_128	Chandler	 (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
0318_129	Monica	 Thats Bill Clinton.
0318_130	Chandler	 Whos he huggin?
0318_131	Monica	 Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?
0318_132	Chandler	 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
0318_133	Rachel	 We use it!!
0318_134	Chandler	 There you go!!
0318_135	Rachel	 Oh my God, Monicas gonna go out with a millionaire.
0318_136	Monica	 Im not gonna go out with him.
0318_137	Rachel	 Oh my God, I cant believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
0318_138	Monica	 Or incredibly offensive.
0318_139	Rachel	 Oh yeah, sure, that too.
0318_140	<event>	Chandler is putting on the Chap Stick the same way that women put on lipstick, including the bit with the piece of tissue.
0318_141	Chandler	 (to the girls who are staring at him) What?
0318_142	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are talking to Frank.
0318_143	Ross	 All were saying is dont rush into anything.
0318_144	Joey	 Yeah, come on, think about it. Youre 18, okay, shes 44, when youre 36, shes gonna be 88.
0318_145	Frank	 What, you dont think I know that?
0318_146	Joey	 Look, the point is, theres a lot of women out there you havent even had sex with yet!
0318_147	Ross	 Yeah, he-hes right, hes right. This is your time y'know, yeah, youre young, youre-youre weird, chicks dig that.
0318_148	Frank	 Okay, but isnt sex better when its with one person that you really, really care about.
0318_149	Joey	 Yeah, in a poem maybe.
0318_150	Ross	 No the mans right, thats what I had with Rachel.
0318_151	Frank	 You dont have it anymore?
0318_152	Ross	 No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
0318_153	Frank	 Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
0318_154	Ross	 It didnt.
0318_155	Frank	 Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.
0318_156	Joey	 Now, wh-what, what is that like?
0318_157	Frank	 Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
0318_158	Ross	 Yeah, yeah.
0318_159	Joey	 (to Ross) Why cant I find that?
0318_160	Ross	 Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!
0318_161	Joey	 Well, I want it!
0318_162	Frank	 You can have it!
0318_163	Joey	 I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.
0318_164	Ross	 Oh, no! No!
0318_165	Frank	 Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!
0318_166	Joey	 Then you hold on to it!!
0318_167	Frank	 All right, man!!
0318_168	Joey	 All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)
0318_169	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, its after Ross and Joeys talk with Frank, and Phoebes is finding out what happened.
0318_170	Phoebe	 (to Joey) Youre Franks best man?!
0318_171	Joey	 I couldnt help it, there love is so pure.
0318_172	Phoebe	 Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!
0318_173	Ross	 Im the ring bearer.
0318_174	<event>	As Phoebe stands there in shock and disbelief, Chandler comes out of the bathroom and walks to his bedroom. Hes just got out of the shower and has the towel wrapped around himself high across his chest, and another towel wrapped around his head, like women wear towels. Joey watches Chandler wondering what the hell hes doing.
0318_176	<scene>	Phoebes, Phoebe is opening the door.
0318_177	Phoebe	 Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. Im so glad you could come, cause Ive got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)
0318_178	Alice	 Oh my God, who died on this?!
0318_179	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know. Its a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
0318_180	Alice	 Absolutely. Okay, first well start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesnt work we can go back to
0318_181	Phoebe	 Y'know what, forget it. Its ruined.
0318_182	Alice	 Oh no-no, never say that. If we cant get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
0318_183	Phoebe	 Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
0318_184	<scene>	Petes office, he is participating in a conference call with three other employees, each of whom are on a different TV screen that he controls with a remote.
0318_185	Pete	 Okay, thats great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
0318_186	All	 Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
0318_187	<event>	The intercom buzzes.
0318_188	Secretary	 You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
0318_189	Pete	 Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.
0318_190	Monica	 What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
0318_191	Pete	 Hang on a second. (to the employees) Ill-Ill talk to you in the morning. (turns two of the three off) Im sorry what?
0318_192	Monica	 Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
0318_193	Pete	 Well, yknow, I never know how much to tip.
0318_194	Monica	 Youre supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, whats-whats the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
0318_195	Employee	 Umm, Im still here.
0318_196	Pete	 (turns off the TV) Youre taking this all wrong. Because, if I didnt leave you that tip, you wouldnt of come down here, we wouldnt be having this argument, and there wouldnt be this ah, heat between us.
0318_197	Monica	 What?!
0318_198	Pete	 Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now were like this-this couple that fights.
0318_199	Monica	 Okay, umm, youre a loon.
0318_200	Pete	 Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think youre great. Come on, what do you say?
0318_201	Monica	 I dont know.
0318_202	Pete	 Why not?
0318_203	Monica	 Cause I dont want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
0318_204	Pete	 One meal! Thats all Im asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you dont have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
0318_205	<scene>	Phoebes, she is coming home. She turns on the lights, and sits down on the couch.
0318_206	Frank	 (hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no! Just put the mail down. Its-its me!
0318_207	Phoebe	 Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
0318_208	Frank	 Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought Id curl up in it. Is that all right?
0318_209	Phoebe	 Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
0318_210	Frank	 Oh, well just probably the worst one since Ive been alive.
0318_211	Phoebe	 What umm, what happened?
0318_212	Frank	 Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
0318_213	Phoebe	 Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
0318_214	Frank	 Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I dont see how I could all of the sudden be too young, cause Im older than I was when we first got together.
0318_215	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah, no, I dont, I dont know. But, y'know what, maybe its just all for the best?
0318_216	Frank	 Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
0318_217	Phoebe	 Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
0318_218	Frank	 Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, its still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now its, and now its gone and I dont know why!
0318_219	Phoebe	 Uh, well I can tell you why. Its, its because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
0318_220	Frank	 What?
0318_221	Phoebe	 Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldnt be together, y'know. And youre gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
0318_222	Frank	 Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
0318_223	Phoebe	 Okay.
0318_224	Frank	 Well, you, wait no, my Mother didnt want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
0318_225	Phoebe	 Okay, but.
0318_226	Frank	 Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought youd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go
0318_227	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is getting Monica ready for her date. The guys are also there. The door buzzes.
0318_228	Rachel	 Oh my God! The millionaires here!
0318_229	Chandler	 (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
0318_230	Monica	 Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
0318_231	Chandler	 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
0318_232	Monica	 I know!!
0318_233	Chandler	 Okay, then get the lobster!
0318_234	Monica	 (opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
0318_235	Pete	 Hi.
0318_236	Rachel	 Hi!!
0318_237	Joey	 Hey!
0318_238	Ross	 Hi!
0318_239	<event>	Theyre all staring at him, with big, huge smiles on their faces.
0318_240	Joey	 Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
0318_241	Monica	 And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.
0318_242	All	 Oh-no-no-no-no .
0318_243	Rachel	 Just one drink?!
0318_244	Monica	 (in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
0318_245	Pete	 Hey, you like pizza?
0318_246	Monica	 Oh, thats sounds great.
0318_247	Pete	 I know a great little place.
0318_248	<scene>	Cut to a shot of the coliseum in Rome, Italy.
0318_249	<scene>	A restaurant in Rome, Monica is paying for the pizza.
0318_250	Pete	 Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!
0318_251	Monica	 Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
0318_252	Pete	 Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.
0318_253	Monica	 Why, how much is that?
0318_254	Pete	 Thats about 60 cents.
0318_255	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, its the middle of the night. Joey is walking into the living room, and runs into the entertainment centre.
0318_256	Joey	 Every night!!
0318_257	<event>	He starts to walk to the bathroom and hears the hypnosis tape from Chandlers bedroom.
0318_258	Hypnosis Tape	 You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)
0318_259	<scene>	Phoebes, Frank is watching TV, and hes very depressed as Phoebe enters.
0318_260	Phoebe	 Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didnt. Theres someone here who can explain this better than I can.
0318_261	Alice	 Hi Frank.
0318_262	Frank	 Hi, Mrs. Knight.
0318_263	Alice	 Phoebes right Frank. I know its hard to hear, but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that what it is?
0318_264	Phoebe	 Yeah, but not just that.
0318_265	Alice	 Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
0318_266	Phoebe	 None the less.
0318_267	Alice	 None the less. Umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)
0318_268	Phoebe	 Thats right, exactly. (sees them) All right, its a good bye kiss, thats good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what Im saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, Ive decided Im gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).
0318_270	<scene>	Chandlers bedroom, hes listening to the hypnosis tape again.
0318_271	Hypnosis Tape	 Cigarettes dont control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
0318_272	Joey	 (Hes recorded his voice on the tape) Joeys your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
0318_273	<event>	Chandler wakes up and stares at the tape.
0319_001	<scene>	Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.
0319_002	Gunther	 Here you go.
0319_003	Rachel	 Thank you.
0319_004	Gunther	 (In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if youd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe youd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
0319_005	Mark	 (entering) Hi!
0319_006	Rachel	 Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!
0319_007	Mark	 Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say.
0319_008	Rachel	 Oh, okay.
0319_009	Mark	 Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it. But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime. So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now.
0319_010	<event>	Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room
0319_011	Rachel	 Wow! Umm....
0319_012	<event>	Shes interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.
0319_013	Gunther	 I dropped a cup.
0319_015	<scene>	The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from their date.
0319_016	Pete	 ...so y'know, thats why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, Wash my car. Clean my room. Its not gonna be able to do any of those things, but itll understand what youre saying.
0319_017	Monica	 Oh, this is so great.
0319_018	Pete	 Yeah, it was.
0319_019	Monica	 All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
0319_020	<event>	She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.
0319_021	Monica	 Hello, people who do not live here.
0319_022	All	 Hi! Hello!
0319_023	Monica	 I gave you a key for emergencies!
0319_024	Phoebe	 We were out of Doritos .
0319_025	Ross	 Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
0319_026	Chandler	 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
0319_027	Monica	 Hes great! I mean we have such a good time together! Hes so funny, and sooo sweet, and Im not attracted to him at all!!
0319_028	Ross	 Still?!
0319_029	Monica	 Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
0319_030	Chandler	 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image ?
0319_031	Monica	 Two.
0319_032	Chandler	 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
0319_033	Joey	 (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)
0319_034	Ross	 I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
0319_035	Monica And Phoebe	 Oh.
0319_036	Chandler	 Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
0319_037	<scene>	A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play hes in.
0319_038	The Director	 Joe. Hows it going?
0319_039	Joey	 Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.
0319_040	Kate	 Hi.
0319_041	Joey	 Oh, so youre playing Adrienne, huh?
0319_042	Kate	 Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
0319_043	Joey	 Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. Im Joey Tribianni.
0319_044	Kate	 Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
0319_045	<event>	She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of coffee.
0319_046	Joey	 So the ah, plays pretty great, huh?
0319_047	Kate	 Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murrays work. Shes so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
0319_048	Joey	 Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
0319_049	Kate	 Where do I know you from?
0319_050	Joey	 Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives . Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat .
0319_051	Kate	 No, thats not it. So, youre a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
0319_052	Joey	 Hey, Ive done plays before. Im a serious actor.
0319_053	Kate	 That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! Youre-youre-youre the guy that doesnt know how to pour milk!!
0319_054	Joey	 See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldnt. Now, see, thats acting.
0319_055	Kate	 Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.
0319_056	Joey	 Yeah, that was real.
0319_057	<scene>	Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind them.
0319_058	Phoebe	 Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
0319_059	Rachel	 I know.
0319_060	Phoebe	 What, so what are you gonna tell him?
0319_061	Rachel	 Well, I told him I would think about it, but Im gonna tell him no.
0319_062	Phoebe	 Huh.
0319_063	<event>	Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.
0319_064	Rachel	 I mean I think Id say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean Im standing there with this charming, cute guy, whos asking me to go out with him, which Im allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like Id be cheating on Ross or something.
0319_065	Phoebe	 Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, youre not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
0319_066	Rachel	 I dont have any issues with my Father.
0319_067	Phoebe	 Okay, so its probably just the Ross thing then.
0319_068	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.
0319_069	Joey	 I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I cant do it, theyre all like-like laughing at me.
0319_070	Ross	 (entering) Hello.
0319_071	Chandler And Joey	 Hey!
0319_072	Ross	 So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
0319_073	Joey	 Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
0319_074	Ross	 Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
0319_075	Chandler	 Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
0319_076	Ross	 Then be supportive like a guy.
0319_077	Chandler	 (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, Id miss you.
0319_078	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.
0319_079	Ross	 Hi.
0319_080	Rachel	 Hi!
0319_081	Ross	 You ah, wanted to see me?
0319_082	Rachel	 Yeah. Ahh, heres a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
0319_083	Ross	 What?!
0319_084	Rachel	 Oh, y'know, its just like hats, and a shirt, and CDs, just sort of stuff that youve left here.
0319_085	Ross	 What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
0319_086	Rachel	 No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know its time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean dont you think?
0319_087	Ross	 Yes.
0319_088	Rachel	 Yeah?
0319_089	Ross	 Yes, I do.
0319_090	Rachel	 Good.
0319_091	Ross	 Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!
0319_092	Rachel	 Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
0319_093	Ross	 Its still a gift! I got it from the gift shop !
0319_094	Rachel	 Okay, all right, give me the mug! Ill keep the mug.
0319_095	Ross	 No!! Y'know-y'know dont do me any favours. In fact, where, wheres the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? Id like that back too. Yes, I do.
0319_096	Rachel	 You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
0319_097	Ross	 Im just trying to help you, move on.
0319_098	Rachel	 Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
0319_099	Ross	 Petty...
0319_100	Rachel	 Petty... (goes into her room)
0319_101	Ross	 Petty...
0319_102	Rachel	 Petty...
0319_103	Ross	 Petty...
0319_104	Rachel	 Small...
0319_105	Ross	 Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)
0319_106	Rachel	 You are so just doing this out of spite.
0319_107	Ross	 Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
0319_108	Rachel	 Huh?
0319_109	Ross	 Im-Im gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)
0319_110	Rachel	 You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesnt even fit you anymore!
0319_111	Ross	 Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
0319_112	Rachel	 (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
0319_113	Ross	 Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. Its an old Frankie says relax T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you dont mind Im gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)
0319_114	<scene>	Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.
0319_115	Phoebe	 So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
0319_116	Chandler	 And youre our age. Youre our age.
0319_117	Phoebe	 Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
0319_118	Pete	 What like Pete Dakota?
0319_119	Phoebe	 Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
0319_120	Joey	 Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
0319_121	Chandler	 Thats not a state Joe.
0319_122	Joey	 Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
0319_123	Pete	 I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.
0319_124	All	 Okay.
0319_125	Chandler	 Youre our age!
0319_126	Pete	 (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?
0319_127	Monica	 Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future? Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?!
0319_128	Phoebe	 Yeah, kinda.
0319_129	<scene>	The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.
0319_130	Kate	 Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
0319_131	Joey	 Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and nothin. You look at me, and its nothin. (He kisses her) Nothing.
0319_132	The Director	 Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice.
0319_133	Kate	 I have a question about this scene.
0319_134	The Director	 Yes?
0319_135	Kate	 Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.
0319_136	The Director	 Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking.
0319_137	Joey	 Yeah.
0319_138	Kate	 I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
0319_139	Joey	 Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, its says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.
0319_140	Kate	 It doesnt say that in the script.
0319_141	Joey	 It does in mine!
0319_142	<scene>	The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.
0319_143	Chandler	 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you?
0319_144	Ross	 You bug me.
0319_145	<scene>	Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date, without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.
0319_146	Chandler	 Is there any chance you didnt see that?
0319_148	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring out the peephole.
0319_149	Chandler	 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
0319_150	Ross	 I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
0319_151	Chandler	 You didnt just break up.
0319_152	Ross	 Hey, its been like three weeks!
0319_153	Chandler	 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
0319_154	Ross	 Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, shes going in.
0319_155	Chandler	 Okay.
0319_156	Ross	 Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!
0319_157	Chandler	 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
0319_158	Ross	 Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
0319_159	Chandler	 Stop what?!
0319_160	Ross	 I dont know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. Ill go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
0319_161	<event>	He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing hold of the foosball table.
0319_162	Chandler	 No!! You cant!!
0319_163	Ross	 Look, they must be stopped!
0319_164	Chandler	 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!
0319_165	Ross	 I need juice! People need juice!!
0319_166	Chandler	 Look man!
0319_167	Ross	 People need juice!
0319_168	Chandler	 Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
0319_169	Ross	 Juice, I need...
0319_170	Chandler	 Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? Its over.
0319_171	Ross	 Yeah, okay.
0319_172	Chandler	 Okay.
0319_173	Ross	 Its just I miss her so much.
0319_174	Chandler	 I know. (He rubs Rosss head)
0319_175	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.
0319_176	Mark	 Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
0319_177	Rachel	 Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!
0319_178	<event>	She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesnt react. He tries it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.
0319_179	Rachel	 Y'know what?
0319_180	Mark	 No. And I dont think Im gonna want to.
0319_181	Rachel	 I cant do this.
0319_182	Mark	 Yep. Yep, thats what I didnt want to know.
0319_183	Rachel	 Well, oh, Mark, Im doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? Im just doing it to get back at Ross. Im sorry, its not very fair to you.
0319_184	Mark	 Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
0319_185	Rachel	 Oh God. Im sorry about this.
0319_186	Mark	 Thats okay.
0319_187	Rachel	 You sure?
0319_188	Mark	 Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
0319_189	<scene>	A Hospital Reception, Monica and Pete are there.
0319_190	Spokeswoman	 ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
0319_191	Pete	 (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?
0319_192	Monica	 Sure.
0319_193	Pete	 Where are we?
0319_194	Monica	 (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, Im gonna say, midget rodeo.
0319_195	Pete	 Just tell me the truth.
0319_196	Monica	 Okay. Umm, y'know, I dont think, I dont think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
0319_197	Pete	 Oh, yeah. Wasnt that like a year ago?
0319_198	Monica	 So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isnt the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now Im just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
0319_199	Pete	 Oh, yeah. I know that.
0319_200	Monica	 I so wanna be attracted to you.
0319_201	Pete	 But youre not. Okay, good.
0319_202	Monica	 Im sorry.
0319_203	Pete	 Y'know what, dont be. This is not, dont be, cause its not so bad.
0319_204	Monica	 Its not?
0319_205	Pete	 I know Im no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, Im just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently.
0319_206	Monica	 Well, um, look I-I dont want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasnt attracted too.
0319_207	Pete	 Yeah, stupidly charming isnt it? Well listen lets, you wanna get something to eat? Cause this place is kinda de pressing. (they start to leave)
0319_208	Spokeswoman	 And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
0319_209	Pete	 (to Monica) One second.
0319_210	<event>	He takes the scissors, cuts the ribbon, shakes her hand, posses for the picture, and leaves.
0319_211	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns to face the other one.
0319_212	Chandler	 I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)
0319_213	<event>	Joey enters.
0319_214	Chandler	 (to Joey) I wasnt doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
0319_215	Joey	 Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
0319_216	Chandler	 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
0319_217	Joey	 God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so good.
0319_218	Chandler	 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
0319_219	Joey	 Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
0319_220	Chandler	 Im talking about you. You big, big freak.
0319_221	Joey	 Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind.
0319_222	Chandler	 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
0319_223	Joey	 Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
0319_224	<scene>	The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.
0319_225	Kate	 Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
0319_226	Joey	 Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell cant figure it out! I talk to you and its nothin. You look at me, and nothin. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.
0319_227	The Director	 You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
0319_228	Kate	 Well, that was ah...
0319_229	Joey	 Better?
0319_230	Kate	 Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. Gnight.
0319_231	Joey	 Ah, Kate?
0319_232	Kate	 Yeah?
0319_233	Joey	 You ah, you forgot your shoes.
0319_234	Kate	 (she giggles) Im probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some more)
0319_235	Joey	 Hey, listen you ah....
0319_236	Kate	 Hmm?
0319_237	Joey	 ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
0319_238	Kate	 Umm.
0319_239	The Director	 (leaning in) Kate?
0319_240	Kate	 Yep.
0319_241	The Director	 You ready to go?
0319_242	Kate	 Yeah.
0319_243	The Director	 (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)
0319_244	Kate	 So umm, Ill see you tomorrow, huh?
0319_245	Joey	 Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
0319_246	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting in the living room.
0319_247	Phoebe	 (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isnt it Spiderman? Yknow like Goldman, Silverman...
0319_248	Chandler	 Cause its-its not his last name.
0319_249	Phoebe	 It isnt?
0319_250	Chandler	 No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man.
0319_251	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
0319_252	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
0319_253	Monica	 Hey, Rach, how was work?
0319_254	Rachel	 Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
0319_255	Monica	 By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
0319_256	Rachel	 Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
0319_257	Monica	 Something wrong?
0319_258	Rachel	 (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)

0409_021	Monica	 Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of people.
0409_022	Phoebe	 How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
0409_023	Monica	 Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.

0409_041	Ross	 Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
0409_042	Joey	 Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
0409_043	Ross	 Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didnt you read Lord of the Rings in high school?

0409_060	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready to party.

0409_080	Mr. Posner	 You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
0409_081	Rachel	 Thank you.
0409_082	Joanna	 Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.

0409_086	Joanna	 Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost every time!

0409_088	Joanna	 Oh yes, well theres the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can carry two things at once!
0409_089	Mr. Posner	 Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
0409_090	Rachel	 Yes, I realize that
0409_091	Joanna	 (interrupting) And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
0409_092	Rachel	 I love working with designers!
0409_093	Joanna	 With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
0409_094	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is there as Monica enters carrying a huge stack of newspapers.
0409_095	Monica	 Hey! My first review is out!

0409_097	Monica	 All right, look at my on the back page.
0409_098	Phoebe	 Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandros? Sure, but Id have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
0409_099	Monica	 Hey, they dont pay me a penny a word to make friends.
0409_100	Phoebe	 Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
0409_101	Monica	 Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
0409_102	Phoebe	 No-no, its okay. But are we sure we dont want the waterbed?

0409_111	Allesandro	 I want to talk to you about your review.
0409_112	Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
0409_113	Allesandro	 Why? So you could hang up on me?

0409_118	Phoebe	 Hey, Monica!
0409_120	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.
0409_121	Allesandro	 (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
0409_122	Monica	 I couldnt eat it! I had five friends who couldnt eat it, and one of them eats books.
0409_123	Allesandro	 Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
0409_124	Monica	 The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
0409_125	Allesandro	 Well, you said that we except the Discover Card , which we do not!
0409_126	Monica	 All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
0409_127	Allesandro	 Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
0409_128	Monica	 Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
0409_129	Allesandro	 (shyly) Lebanon.
0409_130	Monica	 Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
0409_131	Allesandro	 How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
0409_132	<scene>	Rachels office, Rachel is confronting Joanna about her interview.
0409_133	Rachel	 (entering Joannas office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
0409_134	Joanna	 I thought it went very well.
0409_135	Rachel	 No! It didnt! Thats what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
0409_136	Joanna	 Rachel, please, dont make a scene.
0409_137	Rachel	 Theres nobody here!
0409_138	Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now youre making Sophie uncomfortable!
0409_139	Sophie	 Shes not making me uncomfortable.
0409_140	Joanna	 Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)
0409_141	Rachel	 Do you want me to quit?
0409_142	Joanna	 What?! What would make you think that?
0409_143	Rachel	 Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Yknow what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess theres no use to me sticking around til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)
0409_144	Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer. If you must know the truth, I didnt want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
0409_145	Rachel	 What?
0409_146	Joanna	 Thats why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking
0409_147	Rachel	 My drinking?
0409_148	Joanna	 Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
0409_149	Rachel	 Said what? Exactly.
0409_150	Joanna	 That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
0409_151	Rachel	 Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
0409_152	Joanna	 Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If youre gonna get all sensitive about it! I dont want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
0409_153	Rachel	 Say more things like that.
0409_154	Joanna	 You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
0409_155	Rachel	 Id need an expense account.
0409_156	Joanna	 Done!
0409_157	Rachel	 And an assistant.
0409_158	Joanna	 Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)

0409_195	Phoebe	 I dont know, it would totally depend on her coloring and (realizes) You got the job!!
0409_196	Rachel	 Yes!!!
0409_197	Monica	 You got the job?! Why didnt you tell me?

0409_200	Monica	 Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
0409_201	Phoebe	 But weve only had one job.
0409_202	Monica	 I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like its snowballing, yknow?

0409_228	Joey	 I cant hear a word youre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
0409_229	Ross	 Im just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, yknow? I used them as mittens, I didnt want to touch a thing in that last place.
0409_230	<event>	pause

0409_249	Phoebe	 No.
0409_250	Monica	 Okay. Im guessing that if you dont want to deliver, you probably dont want to pick stuff up either.
0409_251	Phoebe	 No.
0409_252	Monica	 Yknow what, lets do the catering business.
0409_253	Phoebe	 Really?! Are you sure?

You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Yknow what, I want you to take the chef job.
0409_256	Monica	 Really?!
0409_257	Phoebe	 Yeah. Thats what you really want. Yeah, I dont want to be the reason youre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really dont want to be the reason Im unhappy.

0409_270	Mrs. Lynch	 I didnt realize that she was so close.
0409_271	Rachel	 Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened.
0409_272	Mrs. Lynch	 No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
0409_273	Rachel	 Yes-yes, just a few seconds and shed still be with usnothing about an assistant buyer?
0409_274	Mrs. Lynch	 (starting to cry) No, Im sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as Sophie arrives.)
0409_275	Sophie	 (happily) Good morning!
0409_276	Rachel	 Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnt hear about Joanna
0409_277	Sophie	 I sure did! (smiles)
0409_279	<scene>	Monicas new kitchen, Allesandro is introducing her to her new employees.
0409_280	Allesandro	 Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much were gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
0409_281	Monica	 Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
0415_001	<scene>	A beauty parlour, Rachel is getting a manicure while Chandler, yes Chandler, is getting a petticure (Does that scare you that I know those terms? Well, it scares me.).
0415_002	Chandler	 Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
0415_003	Rachel	 Chandler, theres a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
0415_004	Chandler	 Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
0415_005	Rachel	 Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
0415_006	Chandler	 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
0415_007	Rachel	 Hmm.
0415_008	Woman	 OHMYGAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. Its Janice.)
0415_010	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Joey are standing at the counter. Monica is flipping a light switch on and off next to the door.
0415_011	Monica	 Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
0415_012	Joey	 Ohh, Nothing.
0415_013	Monica	 Didnt it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
0415_014	Joey	 I know what it did! Nothing.
0415_015	Monica	 They wouldnt have put it there if it didnt do something! How can you not care?
0415_016	Joey	 Like this. (Shrugs)
0415_017	Rachel	 Well, heres another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
0415_018	Joey	 Sure! It flushes it.
0415_019	Rachel	 Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
0415_020	Chandler	 (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
0415_021	Joey	 Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
0415_022	Rachel	 Guess who we ran into today?!
0415_023	Monica	 Janice?!
0415_024	Chandler	 Isnt this amazing?
0415_025	Monica	 How have you been?
0415_026	Janice	 Oh well, Im divorced.
0415_027	Phoebe	 Ohhh, wow.
0415_028	Janice	 Yeah, Im riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)
0415_029	Joey	 And there it is.
0415_030	Janice	 I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you, sweetie, Ill see you tonight.

0415_037	Chandler	 B-bye!
0415_038	Janice	 Bye-bye.
0415_039	Chandler	 Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) I cant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
0415_040	Phoebe	 What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
0415_041	Chandler	 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!
0415_042	Joey	 So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!
0415_043	Chandler	 Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
0415_044	Rachel	 You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
0415_045	Chandler	 (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to break up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike! Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
0415_046	Joey	 Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) Im tellin ya!
0415_047	<scene>	A street, Ross and Emily are walking home from a date.
0415_048	Emily	 I cant believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
0415_049	Ross	 No, its really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
0415_050	<event>	At that moment two very large men start screaming and running towards Emily and picking her up.
0415_051	Ross	 Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
0415_052	Emily	 No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
0415_053	Devon	 Hey, mate.
0415_054	Liam	 How are ya man?
0415_055	Ross	 Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
0415_056	Emily	 So how are you? Ive been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, Ive been rather busy.
0415_057	Devon	 Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
0415_058	Emily	 Oh my God. I think youre right.
0415_059	Liam	 (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
0415_060	Emily	 Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)
0415_061	Ross	 Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingor should I call it (In an English accent) football?
0415_062	Devon	 We were playing rugby.
0415_063	Liam	 In fact were playing a game at the park tomorrow. Youre welcome to play too if you want.
0415_064	Emily	 (laughs) Ross play rugby? I dont think so.
0415_065	Ross	 Whats ah, whats so funny about that?
0415_066	Emily	 Well I mean, youre American to start with. You dont even have rugby here.
0415_067	Ross	 Well, we didnt have freedom here until 1776, either so
0415_068	Devon	 So good then! Well see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
0415_069	Liam	 Cheers!
0415_070	Ross	 Cheers!
0415_071	<event>	Liam and Devon both take a swig of their beers, while Ross takes a swig of his coffee. The Brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, Ross crushes his coffee cup, spilling its contents.
0415_072	<scene>	Central Perk, Chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.
0415_073	Janice	 Oh boy, I just love to sing!
0415_074	Chandler	 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River .
0415_075	Janice	 Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)
0415_076	Chandler	 (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
0415_077	Janice	 I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
0415_078	Chandler	 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
0415_079	Janice	 Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
0415_080	Chandler	 I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
0415_081	Janice	 Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
0415_082	Chandler	 No! No! Not, Paris.
0415_083	Janice	 Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
0415_084	Chandler	 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
0415_085	Janice	 When?
0415_086	Chandler	 I dont know exactly.
0415_087	Janice	 Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
0415_088	Chandler	 But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
0415_089	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are plugging in a bunch of electronics.
0415_090	Monica	 Done?
0415_091	Phoebe	 Yep!
0415_092	Rachel	 (entering, with Joey) Hey!
0415_093	Joey	 Hey! Whats up?
0415_094	Monica	 This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them dont work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
0415_095	Joey	 (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
0415_096	Rachel	 Yknow, you-you also couldve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
0415_097	Monica	 Yeah, well, Im using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises its Joey.)
0415_098	Rachel	 Its coming from Joey!
0415_099	Phoebe	 Oh my God, thats so freaky! Turn him off!!
0415_100	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are watching rugby on TV as Phoebe enters.
0415_101	Phoebe	 Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
0415_102	Ross	 Oh, just hold on a second. Im watching this rugby thing on ESPN . I dont know what the big deal is. Im man enough to play this sport.
0415_103	Joey	 Dude, youre not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
0415_104	Janice	 (entering) Hey there Ross!
0415_105	Ross	 (shocked) Hey!
0415_106	Phoebe	 (whispering to Ross) Janice.
0415_107	Chandler	 Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.
0415_108	Janice	 Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?
0415_109	Chandler	 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not !
0415_110	Joey	 Hey-hey, whats going on?
0415_111	Chandler	 Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.
0415_112	Joey	 Thanks for telling me!
0415_113	<event>	Janice runs into the bedroom.
0415_114	Chandler	 Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the only way I can get rid off her.
0415_115	Joey	 Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
0415_116	Janice	 (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, Im gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. Its a real space saver.
0415_117	Phoebe	 Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller.
0415_118	Janice	 Okay, Chandler, come on!
0415_119	Chandler	 (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
0415_120	Joey	 Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I cant believe you said youd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
0415_121	Ross	 Hey, I can handle it! All right?
0415_122	Rachel	 Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
0415_123	Ross	 Thats cause-cause youre moms dog kept-kept looking at me.
0415_124	Joey	 (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. Thats called a scrum, okay? Its kinda like a huddle.
0415_125	Ross	 And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
0415_126	Joey	 Ross! (Laughs) Theyre gonna kill you!
0415_127	Phoebe	 Well, why are you doing this anyway?
0415_128	Ross	 Well, you shouldve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, hes like Joe Rugby.
0415_129	Phoebe	 Youre kidding! And he plays rugby?! Thats so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
0415_130	Ross	 Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So Im gonna show her how tough I really am!
0415_131	Rachel	 (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) Im sorry. Im sorry. Youre right, you are a tough guy. Youre the toughest palaeontologist I know.
0415_132	Joey	 All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hesChandler!
0415_133	Chandler	 (from his bedroom) Thanks!
0415_134	Ross	 Look, dont worry about me. Okay? Ill just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. Ill uh, Ill be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
0415_135	All	 Oh!
0415_136	Rachel	 Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin at him.
0415_137	<event>	Ross turns and wants to attack Rachel, but Joey stops him.
0415_139	<scene>	The park, everyone is warming up for the rugby game. Only Joey and Phoebe came to support Ross.
0415_140	Joey	 Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!
0415_141	Ross	 They dont look any bigger than me!
0415_142	Joey	 Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
0415_143	Emily	 Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
0415_144	Ross	 All right.
0415_145	Emily	 Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)
0415_146	<event>	A player comes over and picks up a ball in front of Phoebe.
0415_147	Phoebe	 (to the player) Hi.
0415_148	<event>	The player stands up and smiles. Showing that he has no front teeth.
0415_149	Phoebe	 Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
0415_150	<event>	The referee blows the whistle and the players gather to start the game.
0415_151	Ross	 Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe dont know what hes talking about.) Yknow, Red Ross!
0415_152	Joey	 I totally dont know what youre talking about.

0415_154	Joey	 No.
0415_155	Ross	 Youll see.
0415_156	<scene>	Cut to Emily, Devon, and Liam
0415_157	Emily	 Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, its his first time.
0415_158	Liam	 You dont say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and spikes it in his face.)
0415_159	Emily	 (to Ross) Good luck, babe.
0415_160	<event>	The scrum forms and the game is underway.
0415_161	Liam	 Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!

0415_163	Liam	 Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
0415_164	<event>	Ross, urged on by his team-mates, jumps on top of the scrum and falls headfirst into the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.
0415_165	Ross	 JOEY!!!!!!

0415_168	Monica	 He asked you out?!
0415_169	Rachel	 No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
0415_170	Monica	 Saucy!
0415_171	Rachel	 (refers to the table) What are these?
0415_172	Monica	 Electrical plans for the building.
0415_173	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
0415_174	Monica	 I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
0415_175	Rachel	 Wow! If only more people knew.
0415_176	<scene>	The airport, the Yemen Express counter, Chandler is still trying to get rid of Janice.
0415_177	Chandler	 Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
0415_178	Janice	 Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
0415_179	Chandler	 Well, were really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
0415_180	Janice	 On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
0415_181	Chandler	 Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
0415_182	Ticket Counter Attendant	 One ticket to Yemen?
0415_183	Chandler	 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
0415_184	Ticket Counter Attendant	 Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
0415_185	Chandler	 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
0415_186	Ticket Counter Attendant	 Are you travelling with a child?
0415_187	Chandler	 No. All right, yknow what, shes (Points to Janice) gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
0415_188	Ticket Counter Attendant	 Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we dont take library cards.
0415_189	Janice	 Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
0415_190	Chandler	 (to the ticket agent) American Express ?
0415_191	<scene>	The rugby game, Ross is getting killed.

0415_200	Emily	 Okay.

0415_202	Phoebe	 Oh, poor baby.
0415_203	Ross	 (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!

0415_206	Phoebe	 Shes right! You have to stop!
0415_207	Ross	 What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
0415_208	Joey	 Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
0415_209	Ross	 I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
0415_210	Emily	 All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
0415_211	Ross	 No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
0415_212	Emily	 No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
0415_213	Ross	 I like that.
0415_214	Emily	 Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
0415_215	Ross	 Huh?
0415_216	Emily	 One swift kick and hell back off.

0415_227	Monica	 Hi!
0415_228	Rachel	 (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that werent there originally.) What-what are-what are these?
0415_229	Monica	 Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?
0415_230	<event>	Rachel rips one of the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.
0415_231	Monica	 No-no-no, no!
0415_232	<event>	Rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. Rachel then moves onto a third one, but this one doesnt have a hole underneath it.
0415_233	Monica	 I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
0415_234	<event>	Rachel looks at it and then throws it away. She then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.
0415_235	Rachel	 Oh my God! Look at this!
0415_236	Monica	 Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
0415_237	Rachel	 I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
0415_238	Monica	 I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
0415_239	Rachel	 And did you?!
0415_240	Monica	 No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
0415_241	<event>	Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.
0415_242	Monica	 But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
0415_243	Rachel	 Oh my God.
0415_244	Mrs. Chatracus	 Hello darling.

0415_249	Joey	 Yeah, sure.
0415_250	Ross	 No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
0415_251	Joey	 Uhh, look, your eyes still popping out a little, Im gonna go get some ice.
0415_252	Phoebe	 Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
0415_253	Emily	 You were amazing out there.
0415_254	Ross	 Oh, I kinda was, wasnt I?
0415_255	Emily	 Oh my God!
0415_256	Ross	 I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I havent done that since I was four and I washed my dads Porsche with rocks.
0415_257	Emily	 You really enjoyed yourself didnt you?
0415_258	Ross	 Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am. And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
0415_259	Emily	 I think youve got concussion.
0415_260	Ross	 No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
0415_261	Emily	 Youre welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
0415_262	Ross	 Its worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
0415_263	<scene>	The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.
0415_264	Ticket Counter Attendant	 (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
0415_265	Chandler	 Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
0415_266	Janice	 Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
0415_267	Chandler	 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
0415_268	Janice	 Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
0415_269	Chandler	 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
0415_270	<event>	He gives the agent his ticket and walks onto the jetway. Janice walks over and looks out the window. Chandler walks back into the terminal and tries to walk right past Janice, but she sees him.
0415_271	Janice	 Chandler?
0415_272	Chandler	 No!
0415_273	Janice	 Chandler!
0415_274	Chandler	 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
0415_275	Janice	 No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
0415_276	Chandler	 Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
0415_278	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachels, Monica has finally given up on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off aimlessly.
0415_279	Monica	 All right. The super couldnt figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did. Ive had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
0415_280	Rachel	 Thank God.
0415_281	Monica	 I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
0415_282	<scene>	Cut to Chandler and Joeys, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like the Genie did. The switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.
0415_283	Phoebe	 See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.
0507_001	<scene>	Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are there. Joey is looking at a National Geographic and giggling.
0507_002	Chandler	 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
0507_003	Joey	 No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
0507_004	Chandler	 That's a pig.
0507_005	Joey	 I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
0507_006	<event>	Ross enters and his hair is a mess.
0507_007	Chandler	 Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
0507_008	Ross	 Emily's cousin kicked me out!
0507_009	Chandler	 What?!
0507_010	Joey	 Why?
0507_011	Ross	 Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
0507_012	Chandler	 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
0507_013	Ross	 Who needs a lease when it's family !
0507_014	Joey	 Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
0507_015	Chandler	 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
0507_016	Joey	 Yeah.
0507_017	Ross	 You got it.
0507_018	Joey	 Okay.
0507_019	Ross	 Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
0507_020	<event>	Joey starts giggling.
0507_021	Ross	 What?
0507_022	Chandler	 He thought you said gonad.
0507_023	<event>	Joey busts out laughing.
0507_025	<scene>	Monica's restaurant, she is getting inspected by the health department, Phoebe is watching.
0507_026	Health Inspector	 Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
0507_027	Monica	 Oh, Larry.
0507_028	Phoebe	 Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
0507_029	Larry	 No, bribes.
0507_030	<event>	Phoebe laughs.
0507_031	Phoebe	 It's okay to laugh right?
0507_032	Larry	 Yeah, I was just kidding.
0507_033	Phoebe	 Okay. (She laughs harder.)
0507_034	Larry	 I'll check the kitchen floors.
0507_035	Monica	 Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
0507_036	<event>	He goes into the kitchen.
0507_037	Phoebe	 Yum-my!
0507_038	Monica	 Larry?
0507_039	Phoebe	 Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
0507_040	Larry	 (entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
0507_041	Monica	 Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
0507_042	Larry	 And where is your hat?
0507_043	Monica	 It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
0507_044	<event>	She heads for the kitchen door and just after she goes through the door
0507_045	Larry	 Ahh that's the 2 points.
0507_046	Phoebe	 Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
0507_047	Larry	 Oh, I don't know about that.
0507_048	Phoebe	 Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
0507_049	Larry	 Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
0507_050	Phoebe	 Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
0507_051	Larry	 I-I'll call ya.
0507_052	Phoebe	 Okay.
0507_053	<event>	Larry goes to leave but heads the wrong way and makes a quick sidestep to go out the right door.
0507_054	Phoebe	 He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
0507_055	<scene>	Central Perk, Gunther is serving Monica and Rachel.
0507_056	Monica	 Thanks.
0507_057	Rachel	 Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
0507_058	Monica	 Hmm?
0507_059	Rachel	 How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
0507_060	Monica	 He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
0507_061	Rachel	 Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
0507_062	Monica	 Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
0507_063	<event>	Danny enters.
0507_064	Danny	 (To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.
0507_065	Monica	 (To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
0507_066	Rachel	 I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
0507_067	Danny	 (To them) Hey!
0507_068	Rachel	 Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
0507_069	Danny	 Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
0507_070	Monica	 Ohh, fun!
0507_071	Rachel	 Ohh, great!
0507_072	Danny	 Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
0507_073	Rachel	 Yeah.
0507_074	Danny	 Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)
0507_075	Monica	 Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
0507_076	Rachel	 (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
0507_077	Monica	 And you're not gonna do that.
0507_078	Rachel	 That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
0507_079	Monica	 So-so there is no party.
0507_080	Rachel	 No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
0507_081	Monica	 I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
0507_082	Rachel	 Exactly.
0507_083	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, they're entering to find boxes strewn about the apartment.
0507_084	Joey	 Ross?
0507_085	Ross	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
0507_086	Chandler	 Love what you've done with the place.
0507_087	Ross	 Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
0507_088	Joey	 Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
0507_089	Chandler	 Oh yeah!
0507_090	Ross	 Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
0507_091	Joey	 Hey, all right!
0507_092	Ross	 Pretty cool, huh?
0507_093	<event>	They both laugh as Ross heads back to the bathroom.
0507_094	Joey	 (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
0507_095	Chandler	 Oh, the tears are real.
0507_096	<scene>	A restaurant, Phoebe and Larry are having dinner.
0507_097	Larry	 You look beautiful this evening.
0507_098	Phoebe	 (smiles) Show me the badge again.
0507_099	<event>	He looks around and flashes her his badge and she laughs.
0507_100	Phoebe	 Shiny.
0507_101	Larry	 Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.
0507_102	Phoebe	 (laughing) You are just nonstop!
0507_103	<event>	He goes to the bathroom and Phoebe puts some pepper and salt on her food. With the salt she takes a bit and throws it over her left shoulder as she faces us.
0507_104	Larry	 (coming back) We're outta here!
0507_105	Phoebe	 Why?!
0507_106	Larry	 Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
0507_107	Phoebe	 (awed) You have the power to do that?
0507_108	Larry	 This does. (Shows her his badge.)
0507_109	Phoebe	 (excited) Shut it down.
0507_110	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is entering. As he closes the door, Joey pokes his head up from a box enclosure built using the 2 chairs.
0507_111	Joey	 Hey.
0507_112	Chandler	 What are you doing?
0507_113	Joey	 Nothing.
0507_114	Chandler	 You built a fort didn't ya?
0507_115	Joey	 (smiles) Kinda.
0507_116	Chandler	 (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
0507_117	Joey	 Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
0507_118	Chandler	 I hate this thing!
0507_119	Joey	 Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
0507_120	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is opening the door.
0507_121	Rachel	 Oh, hi Danny.
0507_122	Danny	 Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
0507_123	Monica	 Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
0507_124	Rachel	 Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
0507_125	Monica	 You are?
0507_126	Rachel	 Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
0507_127	Danny	 Yeah, what's the gala for?
0507_128	Rachel	 It's a uh, regatta gala.
0507_129	Danny	 Really! You-you sail?
0507_130	Rachel	 No-no, but I support it.
0507_131	Danny	 Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
0507_132	Monica	 Okay.
0507_133	Danny	 Take care. (Leaves.)
0507_134	Rachel	 Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
0507_135	Monica	 What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
0507_136	Rachel	 Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
0507_137	Monica	 Great. So the ball is in his court?
0507_138	Rachel	 Ball? There is no ball.
0507_139	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Ross is working on his computer and Joey is making a lot of noise.
0507_140	Ross	 (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
0507_141	Joey	 Sorry.
0507_142	<event>	Joey starts playing with a toy alligator and has it attack him.
0507_143	Joey	 Ahhhhhhhhhh
0507_144	<event>	Notices Ross looking at him and stops. Ross gives him his 'quiet down' maneuver. Okay, this may take a while to explain, so center this on you screen and place your hands about a foot apart with your fingers together and pointing straight up. Now take you fingers and point them at the other hand and making a 90-degree angle with each of your hands and the first knuckle counting up from the wrist. Now take your right hand, no your other right (that was for the dyslexics, and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.
0507_145	Chandler	 (entering) Hello children!
0507_146	Joey	 Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
0507_147	Chandler	 Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
0507_148	Joey	 No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
0507_149	<event>	They go into his bedroom.
0507_150	Joey	 All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
0507_151	Chandler	 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
0507_152	Joey	 No, the quiet down thing!
0507_153	Chandler	 You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
0507_154	Joey	 Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
0507_155	Chandler	 (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
0507_156	Joey	 All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
0507_157	Chandler	 Okay.
0507_158	<event>	They start playing.
0507_159	Chandler	 No-no-no-no!
0507_160	Joey	 YES!!
0507_161	Ross	 (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
0507_162	Chandler	 Okay, so he's out of here.
0507_163	Joey	 Um-hmm.
0507_165	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.
0507_166	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
0507_167	Monica	 Hey!
0507_168	Joey	 You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
0507_169	Phoebe	 Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
0507_170	Joey	 Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
0507_171	Monica	 I don't know, clean places?
0507_172	Joey	 Umm, yum!
0507_173	<event>	There's a knock on the door and Monica answers it.
0507_174	Monica	 (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
0507_175	Rachel	 Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
0507_176	Monica	 (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?
0507_177	Rachel	 What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
0507_178	Monica	 The fake kind!
0507_179	<event>	She opens the door and Rachel hides behind it.
0507_180	Danny	 Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
0507_181	Monica	 We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
0507_182	Danny	 Thanks, see you at the party.
0507_183	Monica	 Okay, great!
0507_184	<event>	He leaves and she closes the door.
0507_185	Phoebe	 Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." (Laughs.)
0507_186	<scene>	Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are there. Chandler and Joey are looking through the paper.
0507_187	Chandler	 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
0507_188	Ross	 I'll take sports.
0507_189	Joey	 Mine! (He grabs it.)
0507_190	Ross	 All right. Uhh, international.
0507_191	Joey	 Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
0507_192	Ross	 Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
0507_193	Chandler	 Not even on page 7?
0507_194	Ross	 (looks) Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
0507_195	Chandler	 What about that circled one?
0507_196	Ross	 Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
0507_197	Joey	 But it's available now! Isn't it?
0507_198	Chandler	 Yes, it is.
0507_199	Joey	 Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
0507_200	Ross	 Okay, let's go.
0507_201	Joey	 Okay!
0507_202	Chandler	 There we go!
0507_203	Ross	 Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
0507_204	Chandler	 Let's go quicker.
0507_205	Joey	 Yeah!
0507_206	<scene>	The apartment in the listing, the guys are checking it out. There's one problem though, it's roughly the size of this computer screen. As they enter Joey lets out a whistle.
0507_207	Ross	 Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
0507_208	Chandler	 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
0507_209	Joey	 Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
0507_210	<event>	They don't move, just look all around them.
0507_211	Ross	 I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
0507_212	Joey	 But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
0507_213	Chandler	 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
0507_214	Joey	 Yeah.
0507_215	<event>	He looks at them.
0507_216	Ross	 (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
0507_217	Joey	 Oh, it's perfect!
0507_218	Ross	 (To Chandler) How about you?
0507_219	Chandler	 It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
0507_220	Ross	 All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
0507_221	<event>	He exits.
0507_222	Chandler	 We are bad people.
0507_223	Joey	 He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
0507_224	<scene>	Central Perk, Phoebe is there waiting for Larry.
0507_225	Larry	 (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?
0507_226	Phoebe	 Ooh, absolutely!
0507_227	Larry	 Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
0507_228	Phoebe	 Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
0507_229	Larry	 How about Mama Lisettie's?
0507_230	Phoebe	 Enh. Sure!
0507_231	Larry	 (notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been setting out.
0507_232	Phoebe	 Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! Thatthis milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
0507_233	<event>	Just as they're about to leave, Gunther comes out of the back carrying two garbage bags. Larry sees this and stops him.
0507_234	Larry	 Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
0507_235	Gunther	 But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
0507_236	Larry	 Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
0507_237	Phoebe	 Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
0507_238	Larry	 Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
0507_239	Phoebe	 Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
0507_240	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are lamenting about how they kicked Ross out.
0507_241	Joey	 Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
0507_242	Chandler	 Yes that was a nice place!
0507_243	Joey	 Yeah!
0507_244	Chandler	 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
0507_245	Joey	 Yeah!
0507_246	<event>	Pause.
0507_247	Chandler	 What are we gonna do?
0507_248	Joey	 I don't know. Maybe pizza?
0507_249	Chandler	 About Ross!
0507_250	Joey	 Oh! Oh!
0507_251	<event>	The phone rings and Joey answers it.
0507_252	Joey	 Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
0507_253	Chandler	 (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
0507_254	<event>	The apartment manager hung up on him and he hangs up the phone and throws in on the chair. Joey motions, "What the hell was that?" Chandler makes a face to say, "Think about it." Joey tries to divide 136 by 13; he's confused. Suddenly, light dawns on yonder dunder head. He gets it.
0507_255	Chandler	 Ohhhhh!
0507_256	<event>	Joey motions, "Now, that's thinking!"
0507_257	<scene>	Downstairs at Danny's party, Monica and Rachel are coming down the stairs and Rachel has on a coat to make it look as if she's just getting back. But just as they reach the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls Monica back up the stairs.
0507_258	Rachel	 Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
0507_259	Monica	 Just go over and say hi.
0507_260	Rachel	 No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
0507_261	<event>	Monica obeys.
0507_262	Monica	 Hey, Danny!
0507_263	Danny	 Hey! What's going on?
0507_264	Monica	 (turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)
0507_265	Danny	 Salad.
0507_266	Monica	 Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)
0507_267	Danny	 Bread. Aren't you a chef?
0507_268	<event>	Rachel returns.
0507_269	Monica	 (upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
0507_270	Danny	 Hey! Rachel!
0507_271	Rachel	 Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
0507_272	Danny	 Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
0507_273	Rachel	 Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
0507_274	Danny	 Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)
0507_275	Rachel	 Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
0507_276	Monica	 I thought there wasn't a ball?
0507_277	Rachel	 Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
0507_278	Danny	 (returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This is the girl I told you about.
0507_279	Rachel	 Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
0507_280	Danny	 You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)
0507_281	Tom	 So you work at Bloomingdale's , huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
0507_282	Rachel	 (laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
0507_283	Tom	 I'm sorry?
0507_284	Rachel	 No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
0507_285	Tom	 I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
0507_286	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
0507_287	<event>	He walks off.
0507_288	Rachel	 Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
0507_289	Monica	 I think I need a drink.
0507_290	Rachel	 Yeah!
0507_291	<event>	They go get a drink.
0507_292	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Ross still has boxes all over the place. Joey is wearing a football helmet, and Chandler is spinning him around in one of the chairs and counting.
0507_293	Chandler	 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
0507_294	Joey	 (getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
0507_295	<event>	He tries to get up again and starts falling backwards and Chandler catches him.
0507_296	Chandler	 Here we go! Here we go!
0507_297	<event>	Ross enters.
0507_298	Joey	 Hey!
0507_299	Chandler	 Hey!
0507_300	Ross	 Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
0507_301	Joey	 You're kidding!
0507_302	Chandler	 You're kidding, no!
0507_303	Ross	 Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
0507_304	Joey	 But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
0507_305	Ross	 Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
0507_306	Joey	 Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
0507_307	Chandler	 Yeah!
0507_308	Ross	 Are you guys sure about this?
0507_309	Joey	 Definitely!
0507_310	Chandler	 Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
0507_311	Ross	 All right.
0507_312	Joey	 All right!
0507_313	Chandler	 All right, buddy!
0507_314	Ross	 So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
0507_315	<event>	Chandler and Joey smile, but when Ross turns away look at each other with looks of horror.
0507_317	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's and Ross's, Chandler is entering and when he closes the door Joey pops his head out of the fort like before, but this time he's wearing a cowboy hat.
0507_318	Chandler	 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
0507_319	Ross	 (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
0507_320	Chandler	 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
0507_321	Joey	 Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
0507_322	<event>	Chandler does so.
0518_001	<scene>	Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Joey is holding a deck of cards out to Chandler.
0518_002	Joey	 Okay, pick a card.
0518_003	Chandler	 Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
0518_004	Joey	 All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
0518_005	Chandler	 Oh yes.
0518_006	Joey	 (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
0518_007	Chandler	 (pause) Yes.
0518_008	<event>	Joey laughs then realizes the trick didn't work when Chandler hands him his card back.
0518_009	Carol	 (entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!
0518_010	Ross	 Hi!
0518_011	Chandler	 Hi there!
0518_012	Ben	 Hi!!
0518_013	Carol	 Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
0518_014	Phoebe	 What are you talking about?!
0518_015	Ross	 (sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
0518_016	Joey	 (reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
0518_017	Ross	 I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
0518_018	Joey	 I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
0518_019	Chandler	 That.
0518_021	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating breakfast, Ross is heading for the bathroom.
0518_022	Rachel	 (entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
0518_023	Joey	 Luck!
0518_024	Chandler	 Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren , can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
0518_025	Rachel	 Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
0518_026	Chandler	 Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
0518_027	Monica	 Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
0518_028	Rachel	 Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
0518_029	All	 Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)
0518_030	Phoebe	 Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
0518_031	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
0518_032	Phoebe	 Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
0518_033	Monica	 I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
0518_034	Joey	 Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
0518_035	Ross	 (from the bathroom) Okay!!
0518_036	Joey	 Done.
0518_037	Phoebe	 Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
0518_038	Monica	 I would love to do it together!
0518_039	<event>	Joey starts to giggle.
0518_040	Joey	 They're gonna do it together.
0518_041	Chandler	 Dude! That's my girlfriend!
0518_042	Joey	 What, so I gotta shut it down now?
0518_043	Ross	 All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
0518_044	Monica	 It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
0518_045	Ross	 Yeah.
0518_046	Chandler	 Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
0518_047	Joey	 Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
0518_048	Ross	 Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
0518_049	Joey	 Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
0518_050	Ross	 You're not his godfather.
0518_051	Joey	 What?! Are you kidding?!
0518_052	Ross	 (Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
0518_053	Joey	 All right!
0518_054	<event>	As they walk out he motions to Chandler that he is still Ben's godfather.
0518_055	<scene>	Ben's audition, Carol, Ross, and Ben along with about 10 more families are in a waiting room as Joey enters happily.
0518_056	Joey	 Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
0518_057	Ross	 Really? That's great!
0518_058	Joey	 I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
0518_059	Carol	 (noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read) Hey, that kid looks familiar.
0518_060	Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation , and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad.
0518_061	Ross	 Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
0518_062	Joey	 That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
0518_063	Ross	 Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
0518_064	Joey	 I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
0518_065	Carol	 Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
0518_066	<scene>	Rachel's new job, she's in her new boss's office (Kim's) and with the other assistant (Nancy). Together they're deciding what clothes to buy or something, who knows, let's all watch/read to find out.
0518_067	Kim	 So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
0518_068	Rachel	 Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.
0518_069	Kim	 Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
0518_070	Nancy	 She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
0518_071	Rachel	 (laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.
0518_072	Kim	 I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
0518_073	<event>	They all get up to leave.
0518_074	Kim	 (at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?
0518_075	Rachel	 Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories(stops and tries to change directions)about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
0518_076	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is telling Chandler and Monica about her day.
0518_077	Rachel	 and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
0518_078	Monica	 That doesn't seem fair.
0518_079	Rachel	 I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
0518_080	Chandler	 Yeah, it is the best.
0518_081	Rachel	 I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
0518_082	Monica	 Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
0518_083	Rachel	 Yeah, I can do that.
0518_084	Chandler	 Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
0518_085	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
0518_086	Monica	 Hey!
0518_087	Phoebe	 Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
0518_088	Rachel	 I would love to!
0518_089	Phoebe	 Oh good!
0518_090	Chandler	 Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
0518_091	Phoebe	 Oh good.
0518_092	<event>	They all start out.
0518_093	Phoebe	 Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)
0518_094	Monica	 Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
0518_095	Phoebe	 Oh, look at that.
0518_096	Monica	 All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
0518_097	Phoebe	 What happened to the intimate dinner party?
0518_098	Monica	 Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
0518_099	Phoebe	 So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
0518_100	Monica	 What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
0518_101	Phoebe	 Like what?
0518_102	Monica	 (Thinks) Cups.
0518_103	Phoebe	 Cups? You're giving me cups?
0518_104	Monica	 And ice!
0518_105	Phoebe	 Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
0518_106	Monica	 Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
0518_107	Phoebe	 I got it! Mine!
0518_108	Ross	 (entering, downtrodden) Hi.
0518_109	Monica	 Hey! How'd the audition go?!
0518_110	Ross	 Not so good.
0518_111	Monica	 Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
0518_112	Ross	 (Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
0518_113	Joey	 (also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
0518_114	Monica	 You got a callback too didn't you?
0518_115	Joey	 (Happily) Yeah I did!
0518_116	<scene>	The smoker's balcony, Rachel is out to join Kim and Nancy.
0518_117	Kim	 Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
0518_118	Rachel	 Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
0518_119	Kim	 Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
0518_120	Rachel	 Oh great!
0518_121	Kim	 So anyway we really (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.) Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
0518_122	Nancy	 Oh, sorry!
0518_123	Rachel	 Oh that's okay.
0518_124	Kim	 No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)
0518_125	Nancy	 So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
0518_126	Kim	 Oh that's great! You are the best!
0518_127	<event>	Rachel gets fed up and heads over to another smoker.
0518_128	Rachel	 Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
0518_129	Nancy	 I thought you didn't smoke.
0518_130	Rachel	 Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
0518_131	Kim	 We get high.
0518_132	Rachel	 Oh, me too.
0518_133	Kim	 I'm kidding.
0518_134	Rachel	 (Laughs) Oh, me too.
0518_135	<scene>	Ben and Joey's (Isn't that an ice cream??) callback.
0518_136	Ross	 Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
0518_137	Joey	 Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
0518_138	Carol	 Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
0518_139	Joey	 Who knows?
0518_140	The Casting Director	 (entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
0518_141	Ross	 Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long! Later!
0518_142	Joey	 Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
0518_143	Ross	 Yeah!
0518_144	The Casting Director	 Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)
0518_145	Joey	 Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
0518_146	Ross	 Yeah, it is.
0518_147	Kyle	 Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
0518_148	Ross	 No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
0518_149	Kyle	 Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
0518_151	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are talking.
0518_152	Phoebe	 (entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!
0518_153	Ross And Chandler	 Hi!
0518_154	Phoebe	 Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
0518_155	Chandler	 Ah sure. What's in 'em?
0518_156	Phoebe	 Umm, cups.
0518_157	Chandler	 Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
0518_158	Ross	 Seriously that's a lot of cups.
0518_159	Phoebe	 Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
0518_160	Chandler	 Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
0518_161	Phoebe	 Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!
0518_162	Joey	 Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
0518_163	Ross	 Hey!
0518_164	Joey	 Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
0518_165	Ross	 What's up?
0518_166	Joey	 Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
0518_167	Ross	 Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
0518_168	Joey	 That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
0518_169	Ross	 Well, you just
0518_170	Joey	 I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
0518_171	Ross	 What?!
0518_172	Joey	 What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
0518_173	Chandler	 (shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
0518_174	Ross	 Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.

0518_194	Rachel	 I did not!
0518_195	Chandler	 Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!

0518_197	Chandler	 I wish I had smoked for my career

0518_199	Rachel	 No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
0518_200	Chandler	 Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
0518_201	Monica	 Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)

0518_212	Rachel	 Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!

0518_224	Carol	 Thanks. (Exits.)
0518_225	Joey	 (goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
0518_226	Ross	 (entering, angrily) Joey!
0518_227	Joey	 (angrily) Ross!

0518_237	Joey	 Oh, what did I say?
0518_238	The Casting Director	 Hmm, noodle soup.
0518_239	Joey	 How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!

0518_254	Kim	 Yeah. That didn't work out.
0518_255	Nancy	 Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
0518_256	Rachel	 Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
0518_257	Kim	 No. No! You're doing great! Dont you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
0518_258	Rachel	 Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
0518_259	Kim	 Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
0518_260	Rachel	 Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
0518_261	Kim	 (to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.

0518_268	Phoebe	 (following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!
0518_269	Chandler	 Awesome!
0518_270	Monica	 Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
0518_271	Chandler	 There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
0518_272	Monica	 Y'knowgo! Go! Right there! (Points)
0518_273	Chandler	 Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)

0518_282	Rachel	 Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.

0518_285	<scene>	Cut to another part of the room, Ross is going to talk to Joey.
0518_286	Ross	 Hey!
0518_287	Joey	 Hey.
0518_288	Ross	 Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
0518_289	Joey	 Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
0518_290	Ross	 No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
0518_291	Joey	 Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head in disgust.)
0518_292	Ross	 Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
0518_293	Joey	 What you do mean?
0518_294	Ross	 I think, sub-consciously
0518_295	Joey	 Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
0518_296	Ross	 (pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
0518_297	Joey	 Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
0518_298	Ross	 No!
0518_299	Joey	 No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
0518_300	Ross	 There you go. Thank you!
0518_301	Joey	 Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
0518_302	Ross	 No.
0518_303	Joey	 Eh, what are you gonna do?
0518_305	<scene>	The smoker's balcony, Kim and Nancy are out smoking as Chandler sticks his head out the door.
0518_306	Chandler	 (to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
0518_307	Kim	 Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
0518_308	Chandler	 Okay, great.
0518_309	<event>	Kim exhales and Chandler stares at it longingly.
0518_310	Kim	 (to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag from her cancer stick.)

0602_025	Phoebe	 Dont be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Yknow? Mines gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
0602_026	Ross	 Look, all I know is I-I cant have another failed marriage!
0602_027	Phoebe	 So okay what? Youre gonna be married to a girl who doesnt even know about it?!Op, woman ! Sorry.
0602_028	Ross	 Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?
0602_029	Phoebe	 Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!

0602_043	Chandler	 No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
0602_044	Monica	 Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
0602_045	Chandler	 No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom." He may think Im sick.

0602_084	Ross	 (interrupting) No! No, I wont! Ill be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
0602_085	Phoebe	 Ross, youre being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
0602_086	Ross	 Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
0602_087	Phoebe	 Yknow thats really fair. Yknow? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, Ill show you! Come here.
0602_088	Ross	 What?! Why?
0602_089	<event>	She grabs his arm and drags him over to a table where three beautiful women are sitting. Now, Im going to go out on a limb and say that their names are Stephanie, Karin, and Meg. Okay, so I looked at the credits. Of course, only Meg is named later on, so Ill have to guess who is Stephanie and who is Karin. But, well cross that bridge when we come to it.
0602_090	Phoebe	 (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldnt you date him?
0602_091	Ross	 And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
0602_092	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica is pacing anxiously waiting for Rachel.

0602_104	Chandler	 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
0602_105	Rachel	 I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
0602_106	Chandler	 Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty
0602_107	Rachel	 What?
0602_108	Chandler	 (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)

0602_121	<scene>	Central Perk, Phoebe is hosting an impromptu roundtable discussion with Stephanie, Karin, and Meg about Rosss three divorces.
0602_122	Ross	 once you know the stories, its not that bad. First marriage, wifes hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldnt allow you to get married when youre that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevadas fault.
0602_123	Phoebe	 Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldnt be interested? Who wouldnt want to date him?
0602_124	Stephanie	 Well the divorces dont bother me, Id date him. But, not while hes still married.
0602_125	Phoebe	 Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldnt you want a date?
0602_126	Karin	 Actually, Im dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like yknow bad for me, so until I work that out
0602_127	Phoebe	 (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
0602_128	Meg	 Well, I dont care about the divorces either, but I wouldnt date him. Its just that hes obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
0602_129	Ross	 What?!
0602_130	Phoebe	 (leaning to him) She said, "Hes obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
0602_131	Ross	 This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now , she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
0602_132	Phoebe	 Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
0602_133	Ross	 We were drunk! I wouldve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
0602_134	Phoebe	 Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
0602_135	Ross	 (to the panel) Look, Im sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just dont want to be divorced three times.
0602_136	Phoebe	 Yes, and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
0602_137	Ross	 (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-Ill go to my lawyers office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth(leans down to Megs ear)Nothing!!
0602_138	Meg	 Okay now I wouldnt date you because you seem a little creepy.
0602_139	Karin	 I am so attracted to him right now.
0602_140	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are still debating about how to tell Rachel that Chandlers moving in and shes moving out.

0602_154	Monica	 Rach, theres something uh, important I have to tell you.
0602_155	Rachel	 (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
0602_156	Monica	 No! But, Im throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
0602_157	Rachel	 Um-hmm.
0602_158	Monica	 Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
0602_159	Rachel	 (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, thats funny, I cant believe I did that.
0602_160	Monica	 Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasnt clear! Im really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? Theres absolutely no rush.
0602_161	Rachel	 Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
0602_162	Monica	 Okay. Dont you want a cookie?
0602_163	Rachel	 Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
0602_164	Monica	 Maybe, do you need a tissue?
0602_165	<event>	Rachel mumbles uh-huh and spits the half-eaten cookie out onto the tissue.
0602_166	Rachel	 Monica, where did you get these?!
0602_167	Monica	 I made them!
0602_168	Rachel	 Ooh, good God, theyre so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
0602_169	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is packing some books and Joey is watching him.
0602_170	Joey	 God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there."
0602_171	Chandler	 Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
0602_172	Joey	 Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
0602_173	Chandler	 Not once did we do that.
0602_174	Monica	 (entering) Hi.
0602_175	Chandler	 Hey!
0602_176	Joey	 Hi.
0602_177	Monica	 So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
0602_178	Chandler	 Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
0602_179	Monica	 Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
0602_180	Chandler	 And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
0602_181	Monica	 I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Dont I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
0602_182	Joey	 Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channies!!
0602_183	Chandler	 Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
0602_184	<scene>	Rosss lawyers office, his name is Russell and has just been told by Ross about his current situation.
0602_185	Russell	 You got married again.
0602_186	Ross	 Yes.
0602_187	Russell	 So thats your second marriage in two years.
0602_188	Ross	 Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
0602_189	Russell	 Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why dont you tell me what happened.
0602_190	Ross	 Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
0602_191	Russell	 (interrupting) Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
0602_192	Ross	 Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
0602_193	Russell	 Oh, thats better then.
0602_194	Ross	 This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
0602_195	Russell	 I see. Have you considered therapy?
0602_196	Ross	 I think just the annulment for today.
0602_197	Russell	 There are a couple of forms to fill out.
0602_198	Ross	 Easy.
0602_199	Russell	 And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
0602_200	Ross	 No problem.
0602_201	Russell	 And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
0602_202	Ross	 Ooh! Theres no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
0602_203	Russell	 Of course you did. Look Ross, you cant get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
0602_204	Ross	 Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
0602_205	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is painting her toe nails as Monica enters.
0602_206	Rachel	 Hey!
0602_207	Monica	 Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
0602_208	Rachel	 Okay!
0602_209	Monica	 Yknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
0602_210	Rachel	 Okay.
0602_211	Monica	 Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I dont know if I want it because it might be yknow, too many memories!
0602_212	Rachel	 (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
0602_213	Monica	 I dont know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
0602_214	Rachel	 Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
0602_215	Monica	 Something to remember me by!
0602_216	Rachel	 Mon, honey youre not dying. Im just moving out. Yknow, I mean were gonna see each other all the time.
0602_217	Monica	 But still, its a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
0602_218	Rachel	 Are you okay? Youre not blinking.
0602_219	Monica	 Im fine! I just, Im thinking how much its an end of era.
0602_220	Rachel	 Oh, all right. But yknow I gotta say, I dont, I dont think six years counts as an era.
0602_221	Monica	 An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnt significant to you!
0602_222	Rachel	 What is the matter with you?!
0602_223	Monica	 What is the matter with you?!! Why arent you more upset?! Arent you gonna be sad that were not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean arent you gonna miss me at all?!
0602_224	Rachel	 All right, fine, but dont get mad at me. Its-its just a little hard to believe.
0602_225	Monica	 Whats hard to believe?
0602_226	Rachel	 Well yknow, its you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Yknow? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess Im not upset because I dont see you guys going through with it. Im sorry.
0602_227	Monica	 Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
0602_228	Rachel	 But I
0602_229	Monica	 No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
0602_230	Rachel	 It is? Really?
0602_231	Monica	 Yeah, sweetie.
0602_232	Rachel	 (starting to lose her composure) I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
0602_233	Monica	 No.
0602_234	Rachel	 What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
0602_235	Monica	 Im gonna miss you! (They hug.)
0602_236	Rachel	 I mean its the end of an era!
0602_237	Monica	 I know!
0602_238	<scene>	The hallway, Ross is coming up the stairs as Phoebe leaves Joey and Chandlers.
0602_239	Phoebe	 (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
0602_240	Ross	 Oh no.
0602_241	Phoebe	 So? Did you get the annulment?
0602_242	Ross	 I couldnt.
0602_243	Phoebe	 I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
0602_244	Ross	 Its not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
0602_245	Phoebe	 Yeah, complicated cause of the love.
0602_246	Ross	 I I do, I do not love Rachel. Im gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
0602_247	Phoebe	 Ive never been more convinced of your love for her.
0602_248	Ross	 I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
0602_249	<scene>	Cut to Monica and Rachels as Ross walks through the door. Rachel is holding the chrome star and crying.
0602_250	Ross	 Ohh, whats wrong?!
0602_251	Rachel	 Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
0602_252	Ross	 Oh myCome here! Come here! (He hugs her.) Its okay. Everythings gonna be okay.
0602_253	Rachel	 Thank you.
0602_254	Ross	 Of course.
0602_255	<event>	Ross suddenly realizes something.
0602_257	<scene>	Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are talking.
0602_258	Joey	 So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
0602_259	Phoebe	 Oh we do, but not just yet.
0602_260	Joey	 Really?! Well, when?
0602_261	Phoebe	 Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it wont work out.
0602_262	Joey	 Wow.
0602_263	Phoebe	 I know. Then, Im gonna marry Chandler for the money and youll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
0602_264	Joey	 Great!
0602_265	Phoebe	 But then we ditch those two and thats when we get married. Well have Chandlers money and Rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachels drinking problem.
0602_266	Joey	 Oh-oh, what about Ross?
0602_267	Phoebe	 I dont want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
0606_001	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Joey is balancing a mini hockey stick on his hand as Chandler enters from his room carrying a bunch of bills.
0606_002	Chandler	 (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that hes scratching his back with it.) Listen, Im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
0606_003	Joey	 Right! And when is that due?
0606_004	Chandler	 First of the month.
0606_005	Joey	 And thats every month?
0606_006	Chandler	 No, just the months you actually want to live here.
0606_007	Joey	 Ahhh.
0606_008	Chandler	 Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
0606_009	Joey	 (looking at it) Oh my God!!
0606_010	Chandler	 Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while?
0606_011	Joey	 No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.
0606_012	Chandler	 Its not charity, Joe
0606_013	Joey	 No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.
0606_014	Chandler	 Okay uh, heres the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
0606_015	Joey	 This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
0606_016	Chandler	 Uh, yeah.
0606_017	<event>	Joey runs over and shuts off the lights.
0606_018	Chandler	 So, well do the rest of the bills later then?
0606_020	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about trying to give Joey some money.
0606_021	Phoebe	 So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
0606_022	Chandler	 No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.
0606_023	Phoebe	 Well, how much do you think he needs?
0606_024	Chandler	 I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.
0606_025	Phoebe	 Why dont you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
0606_026	Chandler	 Well that would help the pride thing.
0606_027	Monica	 (entering from her room) Hey!
0606_028	Chandler	 Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
0606_029	Monica	 (thinks) Okay.
0606_030	Chandler	 Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
0606_031	Monica	 Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought wed go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
0606_032	Phoebe	 And also, my birthday.
0606_033	Monica	 Its not your birthday.
0606_034	Phoebe	 What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you its not your birthday!

0606_042	Joey	 I dont know Ross, not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
0606_043	Ross	 I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!

0606_086	<event>	Chandler stares at him, dumbfounded, then finally agrees.
0606_087	Chandler	 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
0606_088	Joey	 What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
0606_089	Chandler	 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
0606_090	Joey	 Okay, youre on.
0606_091	Chandler	 Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.

0606_096	Rachel	 You remember when we got these?

0606_099	Phoebe	 You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time (She starts laughing hysterically.) You dont remember?
0606_100	Rachel	 Im sorry Pheebs, I guess Im just really said that Im leaving.
0606_101	Monica	 Im gonna miss you so much.
0606_102	Phoebe	 Well, this doesnt have to be so sad though. Yknow? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things youre not gonna miss.
0606_103	Monica	 I dont think theres anything.
0606_104	Phoebe	 Come on, theres gotta be something.
0606_105	Monica	 Nope, shes perfect.
0606_106	Rachel	 I have one.
0606_107	Phoebe	 Good! Great! You can go first.
0606_108	Rachel	 Uh well, I guess Im not gonna miss the fact that youre never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
0606_109	Phoebe	 Good thats a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Yknow? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
0606_110	Monica	 Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
0606_111	Phoebe	 Okay, good. There you go. Doesnt anyone feel better?
0606_112	Monica	 Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
0606_113	Rachel	 You get your messages!
0606_114	Monica	 Yeah, well I dont think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
0606_115	Rachel	 So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
0606_116	Phoebe	 Great! It worked! No ones sad.
0606_117	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, they are just finishing up another game of foosball.

(Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, theres nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
0606_119	Chandler	 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
0606_120	Joey	 You serious?
0606_121	Chandler	 Oh yes!
0606_122	Joey	 Okay, get ready to owe me!
0606_123	Chandler	 Okay.
0606_124	Joey	 Okay, here we go. Ready?
0606_125	<scene>	In slow motion, as some haunty demonic music plays in the background, Joey throws the ball in, Chandler quits playing and goes for his Chinese food. Joey smacks the ball really hard, shooting it down the table. Chandler slowly takes a bite, the ball bounces off of the wall, heads back up the table, and scores the goal for Chandler.
0606_126	Chandler	 No! No! No! No(Joey looks at him)one can beat me.
0606_127	<event>	In frustration, Joey kicks the table, breaking it.

0606_180	Monica	 Because its my apartment!
0606_181	Rachel	 Well its mine too! What else you got?!
0606_182	Monica	 How about, youre moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")
0606_183	Rachel	 Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
0606_184	Phoebe	 Hey, how are you guys doing?

0606_186	Monica	 (entering) I am not!
0606_187	Rachel	 Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
0606_188	Phoebe	 Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whats going on here. Okay, you guys STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that youre acting mad because you think that itll make it easier to leave. But deep down youre still really sad. Deep-deep down.

0606_199	Joey	 Yeah.
0606_200	Chandler	 Double it! (He does.)
0606_201	Joey	 What?
0606_202	Chandler	 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
0606_203	Joey	 Really?
0606_204	Chandler	 Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card wouldve won. Chandler pays him.)

0606_206	Monica	 Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Im just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
0606_207	Rachel	 Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
0606_208	Phoebe	 Hey you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore.
0606_209	Monica And Rachel	 What?!

0606_220	Monica	 When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
0606_221	Rachel	 Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
0606_222	Phoebe	 Thats nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
0606_223	Monica	 When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
0606_224	Rachel	 Well yknow, I dont want you to be cold.
0606_225	Monica	 And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
0606_226	Rachel	 Oh, its gonna be fine.
0606_227	Phoebe	 Okay Rachel, I cant wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Well have so much fun!!
0606_228	Rachel	 But honey, I think shes moving in with Chandler.
0606_229	Phoebe	 Oh thats right. Youre still set on that?

0606_235	Chandler	 Whats wrong?
0606_236	Joey	 Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
0606_237	Chandler	 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
0606_238	Joey	 The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!!
0606_239	Chandler	 Oh man!!
0606_240	Joey	 And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups.

0606_244	Joey	 Its him, not it!
0606_245	Chandler	 No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
0606_246	Joey	 Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre trying to give me money again!
0606_247	Chandler	 When did I try to give you money?
0606_248	Joey	 Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
0606_249	Chandler	 Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay.
0606_250	Joey	 I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I cant take care of myself. Okay? Look, Im not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that Im gonna missis you. And now the dog.
0606_251	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, (And thats the last time for that line, no more Chandler and Joeys or Monica and Rachels, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying the last table of Rachels. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.

0606_263	<event>	They break the embrace.
0606_264	Rachel	 Bye Mon.

0606_266	<event>	Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachels old and now empty room.
0606_267	Chandler	 (entering) Hey.
0606_268	Monica	 She really left.
0606_269	Chandler	 I know. (He kisses her.)
0606_270	Monica	 Thank you.
0606_271	Chandler	 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
0606_272	Monica	 Can I ask you a question?
0606_273	Chandler	 Sure!
0606_274	Monica	 What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
0606_275	<event>	And with that, an era ends as Chandler moves in with Monica as Rachel moves in with Phoebe. It tis a sad and happy time for Friends.
0606_277	<scene>	Rosss apartment, Chandler is trying to get Joeys money back from Ross.
0606_278	Chandler	 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
0606_279	Ross	 And now you want that money back.
0606_280	Chandler	 Exactly.
0606_281	Ross	 Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
0606_282	Chandler	 Its not a real game! I made it up!
0606_283	Ross	 Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
0606_284	Chandler	 At a fake game!!
0606_285	Ross	 Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
0606_286	Chandler	 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
0606_287	Ross	 No.
0606_288	Chandler	 Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)

0815_098	Mona	 I brought you back a present.
0815_099	Ross	 Wha? Oh, come on. You didnt have tosaltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but its actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. Thats not interesting.
0815_100	Mona	 I think its interesting.
0815_101	Ross	 I do too! I missed you!
0815_102	Mona	 I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
0815_103	Ross	 Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
0815_104	Mona	 How exciting!
0815_105	Ross	 Yeah! I know! It was. Oh the only sad thing is I wasnt around when it happened for the first time.
0815_106	Mona	 Oh no.
0815_107	Ross	 Yeah, Im missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
0815_108	Mona	 (laughing) Yeah right!
0815_109	Ross	 What?
0815_110	Mona	 Joey cracks me up! Its like, Yeah, why dont you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldnt be awkward at all! (she laughs again)
0815_111	Ross	 (not amused) Huhuh-huh.
0815_112	Mona	 Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughsyesagain!)
0815_113	<event>	Ross fake laughs, obviously not finding this funny, and hes starting to panic, so he shoves the whole saltwater taffy hes eating in his mouth
0815_114	Mona	 So, whatd you tell him?
0815_115	Ross	 (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)
0815_117	<scene>	Central Perk. Ross and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.
0815_118	Phoebe	 How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
0815_119	Ross	 I dont know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
0815_120	Phoebe	 Taffy, really? Ive never had any.
0815_121	Ross	 Ever?!
0815_122	Phoebe	 Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, youre just never going to tell her?
0815_123	Ross	 Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, Im going to take her to an amazing Valentines dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks Im the best boyfriend in the world, then Im going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
0815_124	Phoebe	 If I havent said it before: shes a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going towhat the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy, which shes been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? Whats the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, its nice! May I try a pink one?
0815_125	<scene>	Joeys. Joey is laying on his recliner, depressed, and the dog is laying on the footrest.
0815_126	Joey	 So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isnt going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
0815_127	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
0815_128	Joey	 Hey.
0815_129	Phoebe	 Hey, buddy. Hows my favorite dog, huh? Hows my favorite dog? (the dog doesnt move) Youre subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?
0815_130	Joey	 No.
0815_131	Phoebe	 Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
0815_132	Joey	 Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
0815_133	<event>	Joey follows Phoebe into the kitchen
0815_134	Phoebe	 Hes miserable! What happened to him?
0815_135	Joey	 Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
0815_136	Phoebe	 What stuff?
0815_137	Joey	 Rachel stuff.
0815_138	Phoebe	 OhJoey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
0815_139	Joey	 Hes breathing!
0815_140	Phoebe	 Okay, Im going to take him back to Wendys.
0815_141	Joey	 No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
0815_142	<scene>	Ross andRachelsI guess I have to call it that now. Rachel is reading on the couch as Ross enters.
0815_143	Ross	 Well, Im, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
0815_144	Rachel	 Oh, Ive got big Valentines plans! Ive got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
0815_145	Ross	 Yknow, its interesting! Most people think thats made with seawater, when in fact
0815_146	Rachel	 Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
0815_147	<event>	There is a knock on the door.
0815_148	Rachel	 Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
0815_149	Ross	 (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What arehi! What are you doing here? Im, um, supposed to pick you up!
0815_150	Mona	 Change of plans, I made you a special Valentines dinner! Surprise!
0815_151	Ross	 (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like)Ayyyayyyy!
0815_152	Rachel	 (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!
0815_153	Mona	 Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) Whats she doing here?
0815_154	Ross	 I have no idea!
0815_155	Rachel	 Ill be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
0815_156	Mona	 Seriously, what is she doing?
0815_157	Ross	 Uhlately, she just likes hanging out here.
0815_158	Mona	 Why?
0815_159	Ross	 I think shes lonely.
0815_160	Mona	 Okay, but its Valentines Day!
0815_161	Ross	 I know.
0815_162	Mona	 Cant we just ask her to go?
0815_163	Ross	 No, no. Shes way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
0815_164	<event>	Doorbell rings
0815_165	Rachel	 Im not here! Thats just my Chinese food!
0815_166	Mona	 Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
0815_167	Ross	 Mm-hmm. Shesshes emotional, but, but ballsy.
0815_168	Rachel	 You know what Im going to do? Im going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)
0815_169	Ross	 And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why dont you, uh, open the champagne, and Ill be right back. Ive got a surprise for you.
0815_170	Mona	 You got another ex-wife back there?
0815_171	Ross	 (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
0815_172	Rachel	 (entering) Im just going to grab the phone.
0815_173	Mona	 Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you dont take this the wrong way, but, but, um what are you doing?
0815_174	Rachel	 Oh, Im sorry! Do you need the phone?
0815_175	Mona	 No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why dont you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
0815_176	Rachel	 (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.
0815_177	Ross	 (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentines Day! Or something to remember me by.
0815_178	<scene>	Monica and Chandlers. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still staring at the screen.
0815_179	Monica	 How long has it been this time?
0815_180	Chandler	 90 seconds.
0815_181	Monica	 Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.
0815_182	Chandler	 You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
0815_183	Monica	 Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
0815_184	Chandler	 I can do that.
0815_185	Monica	 Okay.
0815_186	<event>	Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion
0815_187	Chandler	 Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
0815_188	<event>	Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they cant do it and back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.
0815_189	Monica	 Oh, thank God!
0815_190	Chandler	 Oh, I know!
0815_191	Monica	 Come in!
0815_192	Rachel	 (entering) Hi! Im so sorry to barge in on your Valentines, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
0815_193	Monica	 Oh, my God.
0815_194	Chandler	 Poor Ross.
0815_195	<event>	Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in Ross apartment
0815_196	Chandler	 Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
0815_197	Monica	 Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.
0815_198	Chandler	 Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it.
0815_199	Rachel	 Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
0815_200	Chandler	 Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
0815_201	Rachel	 Well, now, wait. Now Im all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
0815_202	Monica	 No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
0815_203	Rachel	 Cmon, seriously, you guys, youre not going to make me watch this alone!
0815_204	Monica	 Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.
0815_205	Chandler	 (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.
0815_206	Rachel	 Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
0815_207	Chandler	 Why have I seen this thing three times?!
0815_208	Monica	 Itsstill beautiful.
0815_209	Rachel	 Uh! Its horrible!
0815_210	Monica	 I know! I know, Im so sorry for you!
0815_211	Rachel	 Oh, my God!
0815_212	<event>	Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes
0815_213	Chandler	 Wait, you guys, look!
0815_214	Rachel	 What? Did her ass explode?!
0815_215	Chandler	 No, the babys out! Look, look!
0815_216	Monica	 Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
0815_217	Chandler	 And look how happy the mom is now!
0815_218	Monica	 OhRach!
0815_219	Rachel	 Oh, screw you guys, you dont have to do it!
0815_220	<scene>	Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee as Joey comes fromGod knows where! Some back area of Central Perk around the corner that weve never seen! Weeeiiirrrddd.
0815_221	Ross	 Hey, hey, man!
0815_222	Joey	 Hey, whats up?
0815_223	Ross	 UhMona just dumped me.
0815_224	Joey	 Oh, man, Im sorry. Why?
0815_225	Ross	 Well, with everything thats been going on lately, I havent exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didnt tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
0815_226	Joey	 Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.
0815_227	Ross	 Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentines Day? Whats going on, huh? Girl trouble?
0815_228	Joey	 Sort of.
0815_229	Ross	 Really?!
0815_230	Joey	 You dont have to seem so happy about it.
0815_231	Ross	 Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
0815_232	Joey	 Oh, II d
0815_233	Ross	 Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Yknow, actually onceonce I got dumped during sex.
0815_234	<event>	Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in disgust, and Ross and Joey move away
0815_235	Ross	 Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
0815_236	Joey	 Forget about it. Its no big deal.
0815_237	Ross	 Cmon! Joey! What is it?
0815_238	Joey	 Its nothing.
0815_239	Ross	 Hey, hey, its me. Why cant you tell me?
0815_240	Joey	 Okay, uhsit down. (they do) Um theres this woman that I like. A lot. But, uhit cant happen.
0815_241	Ross	 Shes not a Tribbiani?
0815_242	Joey	 No!
0815_243	Ross	 I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
0815_244	Joey	 Yes.
0815_245	Ross	 Well, uh, does she like you?
0815_246	Joey	 Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it.
0815_247	Ross	 Why not?
0815_248	Joey	 Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends.
0815_249	Ross	 So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?
0815_250	Joey	 No. I dont think so.
0815_251	Ross	 Okay. Um is he a good guy?
0815_252	Joey	 Yeah, hes the best.
0815_253	Ross	 Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
0815_254	Joey	 Oh, I dont know.
0815_255	Ross	 Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
0815_256	Joey	 I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep, I
0815_257	Ross	 Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
0815_258	Gunther	 (placing a cup in front of Ross) Heres your warm milk.
0815_259	Ross	 Im going touhIm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
0815_260	Joey	 Oh, yeah.
0815_261	Ross	 Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until)
0815_262	Joey	 Its Rachel.
0815_263	<event>	Ross just stands in the doorway, for like a minuteAhh! Whats going to happen next??!!! I cant make it all the way through the Olympics!!!
0815_265	<scene>	Ross and Rachels. Rachel is standing in front of the TV holding a video.
0815_266	Rachel	 (thinking) Youre going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, youre going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)
0815_267	Woman On Tv	 I came to the big city to become a star! Ill doanything to make that happen!
0815_268	Man On Tv	 Anything?
0815_269	<event>	Music starts playingyesyou know what kind of music
0815_270	Rachel	 (thinking) Hmmmaybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
0907_001	<error>	Dedicated to the great work of Eric Aasen, Guineapig and many, many more.
0907_002	<scene>	Ross and Rachel's apartment. Ross is playing with Emma on the couch after just changing her diaper.
0907_003	Ross	 And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get ...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon ... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) I'm a terrible father!
0907_005	<scene>	Central Perk. Joey sits at a table and Chandler and Monica enter.
0907_006	Chandler	 Hi!
0907_007	Joey	 Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
0907_008	Chandler	 How come?
0907_009	Joey	 Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
0907_010	Monica	 What do you do with your money now?
0907_011	Joey	 Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
0907_012	Chandler	 Do you have any ideas?
0907_013	Joey	 Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
0907_014	Monica	 Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
0907_015	Joey	 (laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
0907_016	Monica	 Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!
0907_017	Joey	 Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
0907_018	Monica	 (very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
0907_019	Chandler	 (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
0907_020	Monica	 My dad told me. They play golf together.
0907_021	Chandler	 Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
0907_022	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's apartment. Rachel and Monica are sitting at the dinner table and Phoebe enters, knocking on the door.
0907_023	Phoebe	 Hi!
0907_024	Rachel And Monica	 Hey!
0907_025	Phoebe	 Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
0907_026	Monica	 Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
0907_027	Phoebe	 (sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
0907_028	Monica	 They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
0907_029	Phoebe	 They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
0907_030	Rachel	 Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
0907_031	Phoebe	 Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say "neither".
0907_032	Rachel And Monica	 Oh God, neither!
0907_033	Monica	 I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
0907_034	Rachel	 Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
0907_035	Monica	 You went out with Wallis Pincer?
0907_036	Rachel	 Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
0907_037	Monica	 I knew you didn't get a 1400!
0907_038	Rachel	 Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
0907_039	Phoebe	 So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
0907_040	Rachel	 Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
0907_041	Monica	 (Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?
0907_042	Phoebe	 (speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
0907_043	<scene>	Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel enters the apartment.
0907_044	Rachel	 Hi.
0907_045	Ross	 Hi.
0907_046	Rachel	 I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
0907_047	Ross	 Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
0907_048	Rachel	 (in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
0907_049	Ross	 Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) Only... only not creepy.
0907_050	Rachel	 Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
0907_051	Ross	 I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
0907_052	Rachel	 You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
0907_053	Ross	 But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
0907_054	Rachel	 (disgusted) owwwww...
0907_055	Ross	 Please don't take her away from me!
0907_056	<scene>	Richard's apartment. There's a knock on the door.The listing agent opens the door for Chandler and Joey.
0907_057	Catherine	 Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
0907_058	Joey	 Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
0907_059	Chandler	 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
0907_060	Catherine	 Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
0907_061	Chandler	 mmm That's enough about you!
0907_062	Joey	 Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
0907_063	Catherine	 All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here... (Joey and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)
0907_064	Chandler	 No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
0907_065	Catherine	 Oh... Okay, sorry!
0907_066	Joey	 Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
0907_067	Chandler	 We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around)
0907_068	Joey	 You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, I could see it.
0907_069	Chandler	 (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
0907_070	Joey	 What?
0907_071	Chandler	 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
0907_072	Joey	 Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
0907_073	Chandler	 Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
0907_074	<scene>	Mike's parents building. Phoebe gets out of the classy elevator, looking all dressed up like an older woman, and very un-Phoebe. She walks to the door and rings the doorbell.
0907_075	Mike	 Wow! You look like... like my mom.
0907_076	Phoebe	 I'm wearing pantyhose!
0907_077	Mike	 Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)
0907_078	Phoebe	 Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
0907_079	Mike	 No, my parents are rich.
0907_080	Phoebe	 Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents walk in) HELLO!
0907_081	Mike	 Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
0907_082	Phoebe	 (in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
0907_083	Bitsy	 It's so nice to finally meet you!
0907_084	Phoebe	 And you... Your home is lovely.
0907_085	Bitsy	 Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
0907_086	Phoebe	 Holy crap!
0907_087	Bitsy	 Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
0907_088	Phoebe	 Oh, try and stop me!
0907_089	Mike	 Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
0907_090	Phoebe	 (no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
0907_091	Mike	 Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe...
0907_092	Phoebe	 (accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
0907_093	Mike	 Well, come on...
0907_094	Theodore	 Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
0907_095	Bitsy	 Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?
0907_096	Phoebe	 (no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... where does everyone summer?
0907_098	<scene>	Mike's parents house again.
0907_099	Phoebe	 God! God! This is not going well.
0907_100	Mike	 No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
0907_101	Phoebe	 Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
0907_102	Mike	 Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
0907_103	Phoebe	 So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
0907_104	Theodore	 Oh... Well...
0907_105	Phoebe	 Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
0907_106	Theodore	 Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
0907_107	Phoebe	 Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach)
0907_108	Theodore	 OH! OWWWWW! (Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)
0907_109	Phoebe	 Oh my God, are you okay?
0907_110	Theodore	 I recently had surgery.
0907_111	Phoebe	 I'm so sorry!
0907_112	Theodore	 No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
0907_113	Phoebe	 I really, really am sorry.
0907_114	Theodore	 How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach? (Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)
0907_115	Mike	 Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
0907_116	Phoebe	 Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
0907_117	Mike	 But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
0907_118	Phoebe	 Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
0907_119	Mike	 Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)
0907_120	Phoebe	 Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
0907_121	Bitsy	 Well, not at all...
0907_122	Phoebe	 Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
0907_123	Bitsy	 Thank you, I think so too.
0907_124	Phoebe	 Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
0907_125	Bitsy	 Is he really?
0907_126	Phoebe	 Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
0907_127	Bitsy	 E-e-excuse me?
0907_128	Phoebe	 (Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
0907_129	Bitsy	 That's... my boy. (Bitsy walks away)
0907_130	Mike	 Awesome!
0907_131	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's apartment. Only Chandler is there with the videotape in his hands, standing in front of the TV set.
0907_132	Chandler	 I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)
0907_133	Joey	 Hey dude, what's up?
0907_134	Chandler	 Don't judge me, I'm only human!
0907_135	Joey	 Did you take that tape?
0907_136	Chandler	 I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
0907_137	Joey	 I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
0907_138	Chandler	 Some girl...!?
0907_139	Joey	 She hot?
0907_140	Chandler	 Yeah...!?
0907_141	Joey	 How did she get me to settle down?
0907_142	Chandler	 Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
0907_143	Joey	 Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
0907_144	Chandler	 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
0907_145	Joey	 (backs off) What? Whoo... What?
0907_146	Chandler	 Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
0907_147	Joey	 All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
0907_148	Chandler	 Why am I hearing cheering?
0907_149	Joey	 Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
0907_150	Chandler	 Football? Just football?
0907_151	Joey	 Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
0907_152	Chandler	 It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) What are you doing?
0907_153	Joey	 You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey pinning him down)
0907_154	Monica	 What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
0907_155	<scene>	Ross and Rachel's apartment. Emma is sitting in her chair on the apothecary table and Rachel is trying to make her laugh.
0907_156	Rachel	 Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are ... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling "Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
0907_157	Ross	 Hey!
0907_158	Rachel	 Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
0907_159	Ross	 Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
0907_160	Rachel	 Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
0907_161	Ross	 You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
0907_162	Rachel	 Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
0907_163	<scene>	Mike's parents house, the dining room. Mike, Phoebe, Mike's parents and the Angles are there.
0907_164	Phoebe	 ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
0907_165	Mike	 Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
0907_166	Phoebe	 Oh, Pervert Parade?
0907_167	Mike	 (sighs) No...
0907_168	Phoebe	 Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
0907_169	Mike	 Stop! (The butler serves dinner)
0907_170	Phoebe	 Oh God! Is that veal?
0907_171	Mike	 Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
0907_172	Bitsy	 Oh!
0907_173	Phoebe	 Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
0907_174	Mike	 Phoebe you don't have to eat...
0907_175	Phoebe	 No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except Mike. He's making a hmmmm.... face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)
0907_176	Mike	 So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which look in disgust)
0907_177	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's. Monica switches off the VCR. Joey and Chandler are behind the couch.
0907_178	Monica	 So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
0907_179	Chandler	 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
0907_180	Monica	 That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
0907_181	Joey	 (laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
0907_182	Monica	 Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
0907_183	Chandler	 Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
0907_184	Monica	 Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
0907_185	Chandler	 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
0907_186	Monica	 Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
0907_187	Chandler	 Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
0907_188	Monica	 Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
0907_189	Chandler	 Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
0907_190	Monica	 Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again)
0907_191	Chandler	 Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
0907_192	Monica	 THAT'S NOT ME!
0907_193	Chandler	 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
0907_194	Monica	 That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes)
0907_195	Chandler	 Is that a problem?
0907_196	Monica	 I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
0907_197	<scene>	Mike's parents house. Dining room again. Both Mike and Phoebe are not at the table, but the others still are.
0907_198	Theodore	 I can't imagine what he sees in her.
0907_199	Bitsy	 She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. (Mike walks in) Oh, hello dear...
0907_200	Mike	 Hey, what's going on?
0907_201	Bitsy	 We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend ?
0907_202	Mike	 A little better.
0907_203	Bitsy	 By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
0907_204	Theodore	 You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.
0907_205	Mike	 I'm not interested.
0907_206	Bitsy	 Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
0907_207	Mike	 All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
0907_208	Bitsy	 Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)
0907_209	Mike	 So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you . And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
0907_210	Bitsy	 The woman you what? (Phoebe overheard what Michael said and now enters the room)
0907_211	Phoebe	 Yeah... The woman you what?
0907_212	Mike	 The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
0907_213	Phoebe	 I love you too...
0907_214	Mike	 You do?
0907_215	Phoebe	 YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
0907_216	Mike	 Wanna get out of here?
0907_217	Phoebe	 Okay.
0907_218	Mike	 Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
0907_219	Phoebe	 I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
0907_221	<scene>	Ross and Rachel's. Emma is in her bed and Ross and Rachel are rapping and dancing for her.
0907_222	Ross	 She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
0907_223	Rachel	 So fellas
0907_224	Ross	 Yeah!
0907_225	Rachel	 fellas
0907_226	Ross	 Yeah!
0907_227	Rachel	 has your girlfriend got the butt?
0907_228	Ross	 Hell yeah!
0907_229	Rachel	 So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on the beat)
0907_230	Ross	 Shake it!
0907_231	Rachel	 Shake it! (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)
0907_232	Ross	 Shake it!
0907_233	Rachel	 Shake that nasty butt...
0907_234	Ross	 Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
0907_235	Rachel	 One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)
0907_236	Ross	 Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
0916_001	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler and Monica are looking through some papers.
0916_002	Chandler	 Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
0916_003	Monica	 I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
0916_004	Chandler	 I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
0916_005	Monica	 I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
0916_006	Chandler	 Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
0916_007	Monica	 Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
0916_008	Chandler	 You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
0916_009	Monica	 Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
0916_010	Chandler	 No! We're not borrowing money.
0916_011	Monica	 Why not?
0916_012	Chandler	 Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
0916_013	Monica	 Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
0916_014	Chandler	 That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
0916_016	<scene>	Phoebe's apartment. Mike and Phoebe seem to have finished watching a movie on television.
0916_017	Mike	 I'm gonna go. (He kisses Phoebe on the cheek)
0916_018	Phoebe	 Why??
0916_019	Mike	 I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
0916_020	Phoebe	 Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
0916_021	Mike	 I put that tube top on as a joke.
0916_022	Phoebe	 I want you to stay.
0916_023	Mike	 I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
0916_024	Phoebe	 Why don't you turn them inside ou...
0916_025	Mike	 Done it. (Phoebe becomes a little more subdued) I'll be back in a couple of hours.
0916_026	Phoebe	 I'll miss you.
0916_027	Mike	 Me too. (He leaves. A few moments later, he enters again.) You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
0916_028	Phoebe	 Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
0916_029	Mike	 No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?
0916_030	Phoebe	 Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
0916_031	Mike	 So we're doing it?
0916_032	Phoebe	 Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
0916_033	Mike	 Yeah!
0916_034	Phoebe	 I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
0916_035	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Monica enters.
0916_036	Monica	 Hey Joey!
0916_037	Joey	 Hey!
0916_038	Monica	 Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.
0916_039	<event>	Joey frowns...then looks as if he understands
0916_040	Joey	 I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.
0916_041	Monica	 (Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
0916_042	Joey	 Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
0916_043	Monica	 But Chandler lent you money!
0916_044	Joey	 And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
0916_045	Monica	 Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
0916_046	Joey	 Oh...how much?
0916_047	Monica	 Two thousand dollars?
0916_048	Joey	 Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
0916_049	Monica	 Yeah...
0916_050	Joey	 That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)
0916_051	Rachel	 Hi you guys!
0916_052	<error>	Joey & Monica: Hey!
0916_053	Joey	 Oo...what's in the bag?
0916_054	Rachel	 Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
0916_055	Joey	 Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
0916_056	Monica	 Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
0916_057	Rachel	 No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
0916_058	Joey	 You're gonna do it?
0916_059	Rachel	 Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
0916_060	Joey	 Oh, women can. You can't.
0916_061	Rachel	 Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
0916_062	Monica	 You're a pig. And you can't do this.
0916_063	Rachel	 Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
0916_064	Joey	 The hardware store is right down the street.
0916_065	Rachel	 There is a hardware store right down the street?
0916_066	<scene>	Central Perk. Ross, Chandler and Monica are sitting on the couch. Phoebe and Mike enters.
0916_067	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.
0916_068	Mike	 Phoebe and I are moving in together.
0916_069	Monica, Chandler, Ross	 Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
0916_070	Phoebe	 I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
0916_071	Monica	 Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like" (Looks at Chandler)
0916_072	Chandler	 Yeah.... she's not so cute.
0916_073	Mike	 I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
0916_074	Phoebe	 Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
0916_075	Mike	 Yes dear.
0916_076	Monica	 Is that a bit you guys do?
0916_077	Phoebe	 Uh huh...we're playing you two.
0916_078	Monica	 We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
0916_079	Chandler	 Yes dear.
0916_080	Ross	 I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
0916_081	Monica	 I hear wedding bells.
0916_082	Phoebe	 Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
0916_083	Ross	 Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
0916_084	Phoebe	 I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
0916_085	Mike	 You ready to go?
0916_086	Phoebe	 Yeah! You bet roomy!
0916_087	Monica	 Don't you mean..groomy?
0916_088	Mike	 What are you talking about?
0916_089	Phoebe	 Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)
0916_090	Phoebe	 China patterns!!!!!
0916_091	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Rachel is fiddling with the drawer.
0916_092	Rachel	 This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)
0916_093	<scene>	Central Perk. Chandler sits on the couch. Joey sits at the round table
0916_094	Chandler	 Hey Joe!
0916_095	Joey	 Hey!
0916_096	Chandler	 Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
0916_097	Joey	 I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
0916_098	Chandler	 And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
0916_099	Joey	 Yeah, I know.
0916_100	Chandler	 What? What do you mean you know?
0916_101	Joey	 Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
0916_102	Chandler	 Oh! Right.
0916_103	Joey	 (to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!
0916_104	Chandler	 Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.
0916_105	Joey	 Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
0916_106	Chandler	 Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)
0916_107	Joey	 Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
0916_108	Chandler	 Oh ok.
0916_109	Joey	 (To himself) I am on fire!
0916_110	Chandler (Stands Up And Walks To Joey)	 Listen...this is really nice. Do you... (sees his chequebook) Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
0916_111	Joey	 Err... Kind of.
0916_112	Chandler	 I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
0916_113	Joey	 Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
0916_114	Chandler	 What?
0916_115	Joey	 Something personal.
0916_116	Chandler	 What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
0916_117	<event>	Woman with huge breasts cuts across them. Takes Joey's coffee
0916_118	Woman	 Excuse me.
0916_119	Joey	 Boob job.
0916_120	Monica	 I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
0916_121	Joey	 Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
0916_122	<scene>	Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe and Mike are packing stuff.
0916_123	Mike	 Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.
0916_124	Phoebe	 Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
0916_125	Mike	 I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?
0916_126	Phoebe	 Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
0916_127	Mike	 Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.
0916_128	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
0916_129	Mike	 Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.
0916_130	Phoebe	 Oh. Wow.
0916_131	Mike	 It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
0916_132	Phoebe	 Was it really that bad?
0916_133	Mike	 At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
0916_134	Phoebe	 Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
0916_135	Mike	 Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
0916_136	Phoebe	 But it's just...
0916_137	Mike	 Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.
0916_138	Phoebe	 Oh!
0916_139	Mike	 I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
0916_140	Phoebe	 No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
0916_141	Mike	 Trust me, I will never...
0916_142	Phoebe	 Yeah I get that.
0916_143	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Rachel is flipping through magazines. Handyman is installing things. Monica enters.
0916_144	Rachel	 Hi!
0916_145	Monica	 So you gave in and decided to call someone?
0916_146	Rachel	 Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
0916_147	Handyman	 You're all set. (picks up his bag and starts to leave)
0916_148	Rachel	 Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)
0916_149	Handyman	 Thanks.....
0916_150	<event>	Chandler enters
0916_151	Chandler	 Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
0916_152	Rachel	 Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
0916_153	Monica	 Thank you?
0916_154	Chandler	 Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
0916_155	Monica	 Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
0916_156	Chandler	 No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
0916_157	Monica	 Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
0916_158	Chandler	 Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
0916_159	Monica	 Okay...
0916_160	Chandler	 I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
0916_161	<event>	He leaves
0916_162	Rachel	 Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
0916_163	Monica	 I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
0916_164	Rachel	 I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?
0916_165	Monica	 Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
0916_166	Rachel	 No you really think that's what it is?
0916_167	Monica	 You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
0916_168	Rachel	 Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!
0916_169	<scene>	Ross's apartment. Phoebe is at the door.
0916_170	Phoebe	 Hi
0916_171	Ross	 Hey!
0916_172	Phoebe	 Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
0916_173	Ross	 Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
0916_174	Phoebe	 No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
0916_175	Ross	 Why?
0916_176	Phoebe	 Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
0916_177	Ross	 Never?
0916_178	Phoebe	 Never.
0916_179	Ross	 wow, are you still going to move in with him?
0916_180	Phoebe	 I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
0916_181	Ross	 Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
0916_182	Phoebe	 That's not how you really feel is it?
0916_183	Ross	 No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
0916_184	Phoebe	 Seriously? You divorce-o?
0916_185	Ross	 If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
0916_186	Phoebe	 It's ok that's how you feel.
0916_187	Ross	 But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
0916_188	Phoebe	 I do love Mike.
0916_189	Ross	 Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
0916_190	Phoebe	 Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
0916_191	Ross	 The Divorcer, to the rescue!
0916_192	Phoebe	 It's not cooler.
0916_193	Ross	 Yeah I just hurt it.
0916_194	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Joey enters carrying a tub of ice cream. He sets it on the table, takes off his jacket and struggles with the drawer. It cannot be opened.
0916_195	Joey	 Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????
0916_196	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler enters. Rachel and monica are seated at the table.
0916_197	Chandler	 Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
0916_198	Monica	 Honey?
0916_199	Chandler	 Yeah?
0916_200	Monica	 About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
0916_201	Chandler	 But honey you don't have to.
0916_202	Monica	 I'm going to get bigger!
0916_203	Chandler	 Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
0916_204	Rachel	 Argh. fascist
0916_205	Monica	 Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
0916_206	Chandler	 your ass?!?!?
0916_207	Rachel	 Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
0916_208	Chandler	 They...do that?
0916_209	Monica	 It's kind of a package deal!
0916_210	Chandler	 God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
0916_211	Monica	 I thought I was something that we both wanted!
0916_212	Chandler	 Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
0916_213	Rachel	 Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
0916_214	Chandler	 (sedated) What?
0916_215	<scene>	Joey's apartment. He's prying open the drawer with a crowbar to no avail. Monica, Rachel and Chandler enter.
0916_216	Rachel	 Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
0916_217	Joey	 Because she is!
0916_218	Monica	 Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
0916_219	Joey	 Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
0916_220	Monica, Rachel, Chandler	 It's over/Joe!
0916_221	Joey	 OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
0916_222	<scene>	Phoebe's apartment. Ross is helping with the packing, Phoebe and Mike are also there.
0916_223	Ross	 Hey! What do you guys think about this. " Ross: The Divorce-Force".
0916_224	Phoebe	 Better.
0916_225	Mike	 Very cool.
0916_226	Ross	 Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
0916_227	Phoebe	 Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
0916_228	Ross	 Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
0916_229	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
0916_230	Ross	 Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
0916_231	Phoebe	 They are awfully boxy...
0916_232	Ross	 I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
0916_233	Phoebe	 Uh huh.
0916_234	<event>	Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are carrying a couch through the door
0916_235	Ross	 Hey hey, can I help?
0916_236	Chandler	 Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
0916_237	Ross	 You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
0916_238	Joey	 Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
0916_239	Rachel	 Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
0916_240	Phoebe	 Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
0916_241	Mike	 No but... You don't want to get married either right?
0916_242	Phoebe	 Right. Except that I do want to get married.
0916_243	Joey	 (voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
0916_244	Mike	 You wanna get married?
0916_245	Phoebe	 Someday.
0916_246	Chandler	 Aaaaand....... hernia.
0916_247	Phoebe	 I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
0916_248	Mike	 But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
0916_249	Phoebe	 Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
0916_250	Mike	 I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
0916_251	Phoebe	 But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
0916_252	Mike	 Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
0916_253	Phoebe	 Are you gonna change yours?
0916_254	Mike	 No.
0916_255	Phoebe	 Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
0916_256	Mike	 But I don't want this to end.
0916_257	Phoebe	 I don't want it to end either.
0916_258	Mike	 I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
0916_259	Phoebe	 Yeah.
0916_260	Mike	 Ok... so...(They hug) Goodbye.
0916_261	<error>	Chandler/Joey/Rachel/Monica: Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
0916_262	Rachel	 I'm so sorry Pheebs.
0916_263	Monica	 We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)
0916_264	Chandler	 Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)
0916_266	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Joey is struggling with the fridge. He finally gets it open and falls on the floor
0916_267	Joey	 AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
1012_002	<scene>	Central Perk. Joey's sitting on the couch and Phoebe enters.
1012_003	Phoebe	 Oh, hey Joey.
1012_004	Joey	 Uh, hey.
1012_005	Phoebe	 Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
1012_006	Joey	 (afraid) Yeah.
1012_007	Phoebe	 Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
1012_008	Joey	 So he can't come?
1012_009	Phoebe	 No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
1012_010	Joey	 Seriously?
1012_011	Phoebe	 Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
1012_012	Joey	 I am pretty wisdomous.
1012_013	Phoebe	 So... what do you say?
1012_014	Joey	 Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)
1012_015	Phoebe	 Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
1012_016	Joey	 (takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
1012_019	<scene>	Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch. A waitress brings a coffee and Phoebe wants to pay.
1012_020	Phoebe	 Oh.
1012_021	Joey	 Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
1012_022	Phoebe	 (her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy ! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
1012_023	Monica	 (she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!
1012_024	Phoebe	 Well, I don't care, so you pick!
1012_025	Monica	 Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
1012_026	Phoebe	 Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
1012_027	Monica	 You don't know military time?
1012_028	Phoebe	 Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
1012_029	Monica	 Just subtract twelve.
1012_030	Phoebe	 Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
1012_031	Monica	 (screaming) Six o'clock!
1012_032	Phoebe	 Ok.
1012_033	Monica	 Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
1012_034	Phoebe	 Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
1012_035	Monica	 Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
1012_036	Phoebe	 What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
1012_037	Monica	 Ooh... she backed out.
1012_038	Phoebe	 She did? Why?
1012_039	Monica	 I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
1012_040	Phoebe	 (looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
1012_042	<scene>	The wedding rehearsal dinner.
1012_043	Chandler	 Hey!
1012_044	Phoebe	 Hey!
1012_045	Chandler	 You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
1012_046	Phoebe	 Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
1012_047	Chandler	 No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
1012_048	Phoebe	 Rehearse it!
1012_049	Ross	 Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
1012_050	Mike	 Thanks for coming you guys.
1012_051	Ross	 Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
1012_052	Mike	 Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
1012_053	Ross	 That is why !
1012_054	Mike	 Yeah.
1012_055	Phoebe	 So Rach.
1012_056	Rachel	 Yeah.
1012_057	Phoebe	 Where is Emma?
1012_058	Rachel	 Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
1012_059	Monica	 (coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
1012_060	Joey	 Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
1012_061	Mike'S Mother	 Yes, we are.
1012_062	Joey	 Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
1012_063	Mike'S Father	 How's that?
1012_064	Joey	 You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
1012_065	Mike'S Father	 Who in God's name are you?
1012_066	Joey	 Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
1012_067	<event>	cut to Ross, Chandler and Rachel
1012_068	Chandler	 (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
1012_069	Ross	 Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
1012_070	Rachel	 Uh... November?
1012_071	Ross	 I wanna say it's not looking good.
1012_072	Rachel	 Hey Pheebs...
1012_073	Phoebe	 What's up?
1012_074	Rachel	 Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
1012_075	Chandler	 Heh.
1012_076	Phoebe	 Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
1012_077	Ross	 What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
1012_078	Rachel	 Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!
1012_079	Phoebe	 I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
1012_080	Ross	 Oh, man!
1012_081	Chandler	 This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
1012_082	Ross	 FOOTBALL!
1012_083	Chandler	 Thank you.
1012_084	Monica	 (looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
1012_085	Phoebe	 Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
1012_086	Monica	 Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
1012_087	Phoebe	 I don't have a fax machine.
1012_088	Monica	 Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
1012_089	Ross	 I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
1012_090	Chandler	 I know, I hate being left out of things.
1012_091	Ross	 And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
1012_092	Mike	 Hey guys, how is it going?
1012_093	Chandler	 Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
1012_094	Mike	 Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
1012_095	Chandler	 What happened?
1012_096	Ross	 Who cares, AND?
1012_097	Mike	 ...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up)
1012_098	Ross	 I'll do it!
1012_099	Chandler	 (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
1012_100	Mike	 You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
1012_101	Chandler	 Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
1012_102	Ross	 No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
1012_103	Mike	 You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)
1012_104	Ross	 (to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
1012_105	Chandler	 Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
1012_106	Ross	 Please, you're going down!
1012_107	Chandler	 You are going downer!
1012_108	Ross	 Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
1012_109	Chandler	 (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
1012_111	<scene>	Wedding rehearsal dinner. Joey and Mike are talking.
1012_112	Joey	 So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
1012_113	Mike	 Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
1012_114	Joey	 Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
1012_115	Mike	 I intend to marry her.
1012_116	Joey	 Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano ? Isn't that kind of unstable?
1012_117	Mike	 No more so than acting.
1012_118	Joey	 Strike two!
1012_119	Mike	 You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
1012_120	Joey	 Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
1012_121	<event>	Cut to Chandler and Ross. Phoebe comes out of the ladies room and they run toward her.
1012_122	Ross	 So, what did you decide?
1012_123	Phoebe	 I decided to pee.
1012_124	Chandler	 Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
1012_125	Phoebe	 Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
1012_126	Chandler	 Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
1012_127	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
1012_128	Rachel	 (excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!
1012_129	Phoebe	 Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
1012_130	Rachel	 What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
1012_131	Phoebe	 All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
1012_132	Ross	 I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
1012_133	Monica	 Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
1012_134	Mike	 Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
1012_135	Monica	 You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
1012_136	Mike	 Is that what you say to Chandler?
1012_137	Monica	 (very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
1012_138	Phoebe	 Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
1012_139	Monica (Rolling Her Eyes)	 oh God.
1012_140	Phoebe	 And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.
1012_141	Monica	 What?
1012_142	Phoebe	 YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
1012_144	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Joey's having breakfast; Phoebe enters the room carrying her wedding dress.
1012_145	Phoebe	 Hey!
1012_146	Rachel	 Happy wedding day!
1012_147	Phoebe	 Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
1012_148	Rachel	 Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
1012_149	Joey	 Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
1012_150	<event>	Monica enters the room
1012_151	Monica	 Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
1012_152	Phoebe	 Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
1012_153	Monica	 Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
1012_154	Phoebe	 Wow, this is a lot!
1012_155	Monica	 Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
1012_156	Phoebe	 You won awards?
1012_157	Monica	 Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
1012_158	<event>	Ross enters the room
1012_159	Ross	 Hey!
1012_160	Monica	 Hi.
1012_161	Ross	 Where's Rach?
1012_162	Monica	 She's in her room, why?
1012_163	Ross	 I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
1012_164	Rachel	 What d'you want?
1012_165	Ross	 You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
1012_166	Rachel	 Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
1012_167	Ross	 I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
1012_168	Rachel	 Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
1012_169	Ross	 Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
1012_170	Rachel	 Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
1012_171	Ross	 (waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!
1012_173	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Phoebe is talking at the phone, Monica is listening amused.
1012_174	Phoebe	 Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
1012_175	Monica	 I know.
1012_176	<event>	Mike enters the room.
1012_177	Mike	 Hey.
1012_178	Phoebe	 Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
1012_179	Mike	 (thinks a moment) Orchids?
1012_180	Phoebe	 Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
1012_181	<event>	Joey comes out from his room
1012_182	Joey	 (to Mike) Hello Michael.
1012_183	Mike	 Joseph.
1012_184	Joey	 May I have a word with you, please?
1012_185	Mike	 (looking around the room) This is... great...
1012_186	Joey	 Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this.
1012_187	Mike	 (not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
1012_188	Joey	 More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
1012_189	Mike	 Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
1012_190	Joey	 I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
1012_191	Mike	 (gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
1012_192	Joey	 (very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
1012_193	Mike	 That must have been one lousy movie.
1012_194	Joey	 (almost crying) That was ME!
1012_196	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is pacing and Rachel walks in.
1012_197	Rachel	 Hi
1012_198	Chandler	 Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
1012_199	Rachel	 Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
1012_200	Chandler	 Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
1012_201	Rachel	 All right fine, I pick you.
1012_202	Chandler	 (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
1012_203	Rachel	 (not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
1012_205	<scene>	Joey and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe is on the phone and Monica is nonchalantly "minding her own business".
1012_206	Phoebe	 No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello?
1012_207	<event>	Mike and Joey come out of Joey's room
1012_208	Joey	 I'm glad we had this little talk.
1012_209	Mike	 Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
1012_210	Phoebe	 Okay.
1012_211	Monica	 Bye.
1012_212	<event>	Mike opens the door and there is a gigantic ice sculpture standing in the doorway
1012_213	Mike	 Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
1012_214	Phoebe	 Oh my God, what's it doing here?
1012_215	Monica	 (Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.
1012_216	Phoebe	 (starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
1012_217	Joey	 (staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
1012_219	<scene>	Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee at the counter. Chandler walks in.
1012_220	Chandler	 How's it going?
1012_221	Ross	 (smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
1012_222	Chandler	 (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
1012_223	Ross	 (barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.
1012_224	Chandler	 You too.
1012_225	Ross	 Oh, I will.
1012_226	Chandler	 Me too.
1012_227	<event>	They walk passed each other, Ross towards the door, Chandler towards the counter, suddenly they turn around to face each other
1012_228	Ross	 Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
1012_229	Chandler	 I'm not supposed to tell you.
1012_230	Ross	 I'm not supposed to tell you!
1012_231	<event>	Cut to Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Ross storm in looking very unhappy
1012_232	Chandler	 You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
1012_233	Rachel	 Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
1012_234	Ross	 Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
1012_235	Chandler	 Rach, Rach, knock knock.
1012_236	Rachel	 Who's there?
1012_237	Chandler	 I'll tell you at the wedding.
1012_238	Rachel	 Uh.
1012_239	<event>	Mike walks in.
1012_240	Mike	 Hey, I forgot my scarf.
1012_241	Rachel	 You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
1012_242	Mike	 Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
1012_243	Ross	 What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
1012_244	<event>	all eyes turn to Rachel
1012_245	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
1012_246	<event>	Ross and Chandler look shocked
1012_247	<event>	Cut to Phoebe who is in the living room, still on the phone.
1012_248	Phoebe	 Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
1012_249	Monica	 (enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?
1012_250	Phoebe	 (to Monica) Help me.
1012_251	Monica	 What?
1012_252	Phoebe	 I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
1012_253	Monica	 (Sounds moved) Really?
1012_254	Phoebe	 (Nearly in tears) Please?
1012_255	Monica	 You really want me to come back?
1012_256	Phoebe	 More than I wanna get married.
1012_257	Monica	 Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
1012_258	<event>	Joey walks in
1012_259	Joey	 Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
1012_260	Phoebe	 (sounds scared already) About what?
1012_261	Joey	 The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
1012_262	Monica	 Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
1012_263	Joey	 I don't think they are.
1012_264	Ross	 (to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
1012_266	<scene>	Monica's apartment. They are all sitting around.
1012_267	Monica	 (Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.
1012_268	Joey	 Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
1012_269	Rachel	 Since when do you watch the news?
1012_270	Joey	 Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
1012_271	Ross	 (To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
1012_272	Phoebe	 I know.
1012_273	Rachel	 Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
1012_274	Phoebe	 What?
1012_275	Rachel	 Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
1012_276	Phoebe	 (Turning to Mike) What do you think?
1012_277	Mike	 I think I wanna get married to you today.
1012_278	Phoebe	 Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?
1012_279	Monica	 (thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
1012_281	<scene>	Outside. They are a bunch of people arranging chairs, shoveling snow and making other preparations.
1012_282	Monica	 (walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
1012_283	Mike'S Mom	 Michael!
1012_284	Mike	 Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
1012_285	Mike'S Mom	 No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
1012_286	Mike'S Dad	 (leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.
1012_287	Mike	 (to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
1012_288	Chandler	 So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
1012_289	Mike	 I guess.
1012_290	Chandler And Ross	 I'll do it!
1012_291	Ross	 No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
1012_292	Chandler	 I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
1012_293	Ross	 (takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
1012_294	Monica	 Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
1012_295	Mike	 Oh, no!
1012_296	Joey	 Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
1012_297	Monica	 Really?
1012_298	Joey	 Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
1012_299	Ross	 Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
1012_300	Joey	 I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
1012_301	Monica	 Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
1012_302	Chandler	 (quickly) I'll do it.
1012_303	Ross	 I'll...
1012_304	Chandler	 (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
1012_305	Monica	 Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
1012_306	<event>	Cut to inside Central Perk where Rachel is helping Phoebe. Chandler and Monica enter.
1012_307	Monica	 Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
1012_308	Phoebe	 Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)
1012_309	Monica	 So, you're ready to do this?
1012_310	Phoebe	 Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
1012_311	Rachel	 Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
1012_312	Phoebe	 Oh, thank you.
1012_313	Monica	 I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
1012_314	Phoebe	 I love you guys.
1012_315	Rachel And Monica	 I love you.
1012_316	Monica	 Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
1012_317	Chandler	 (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
1012_318	Monica	 (checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
1012_319	Chandler	 Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
1012_320	Monica	 Okay Marjorie, hit it.
1012_321	<event>	A woman with a steel drum and a guy with a xylophone start playing an instrumental version of "Can't Help Falling In Love" by Elvis Presley. A bridesmaid and a groomsman walk down the isle. Next are Rachel and Ross, who carries Chappy in his arms.
1012_322	Rachel	 Geez Ross, you could have showered.
1012_323	Ross	 It's the dog .
1012_324	<event>	we cut to Monica
1012_325	Monica	 Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.
1012_326	<event>	She walks down the aisle with the groomsman. We cut to inside Central Perk, where Phoebe and Chandler are waiting.
1012_327	Chandler	 Ready?
1012_328	Phoebe	 (nervously) Okay.
1012_329	Chandler	 Okay.
1012_330	Phoebe	 Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
1012_331	<event>	She takes off the coat she was wearing over her wedding dress, which is violet and has a darker shade petticoat underneath which shows at one side where the dress is lifted up to about the height of her hip and connected to the petticoat. She's wearing a veil over her curly hair and a low cut top with straps only just hanging over her shoulders.
1012_332	Chandler	 Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
1012_333	Phoebe	 I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
1012_334	Chandler	 You look beautiful.
1012_335	Phoebe	 Thank you.
1012_336	<event>	They start to leave Central Perk. The band starts to play "Here, There and Everywhere" by the Beatles. The crowd rises from their seats. Phoebe and Chandler walk down the aisle. Phoebe really glows with happiness. So does Mike who watches her walk down the isle. When Phoebe and Chandler arrive, they kiss and Phoebe walks to her bridesmaids.
1012_337	Mike	 My God! Aren't you freezing?
1012_338	Phoebe	 Na-ah.
1012_339	<event>	the music ends
1012_340	Joey	 Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
1012_341	<event>	one of the groomsmen gives the rings to Joey
1012_342	Joey	 (whispering to Phoebe) Okay...
1012_343	Phoebe	 When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)
1012_344	Mike	 Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)
1012_345	Phoebe	 Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
1012_346	Mike	 I love you too.
1012_347	Ross	 Uh Joey...
1012_348	Joey	 Yeah?
1012_349	Ross	 Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down .
1012_350	Joey	 Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
1012_351	Phoebe	 I do.
1012_352	<event>	Joey has a "Yeah you do" smile on his face
1012_353	Joey	 Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
1012_354	Mike	 I do.
1012_355	Joey	 I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
1012_356	<event>	Phoebe and Mike kiss
1012_357	Phoebe	 I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
1012_358	<event>	Mike takes off his coat to give to Phoebe and the steel band plays "The Wedding Song"
1012_361	<scene>	The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler and Joey are walking up the stairs.
1012_362	Chandler	 That really was an incredible wedding.
1012_363	Joey	 It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
1012_364	Chandler	 I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
1012_365	Joey	 Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
1012_366	Chandler	 I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
1012_367	<event>	cut to the street in front of Central Perk where Ross is walking Chappy. He has a plastic bag in his hand.
1012_368	Ross	 Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
