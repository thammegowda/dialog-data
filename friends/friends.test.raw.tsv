0116_082	Chandler	 Oh, okay. Send her in.
0116_083	<event>	He hurriedly checks his hair in his computer screen, before taking a sporting trophy from a drawer to place ostentatiously on his desk. An attractive young woman opens the door.
0116_084	Nina	 Hi.

0116_086	Nina	 You wanted to see me?

0116_093	<event>	Nina beams flirtatiously at Chandler, who catches her drift, but for once hes lost for something to say &ndash; so she nods her head to tell him that hes thinking correctly...

0116_101	Monica	 Great.
0116_102	Ross	 Relax, Ill fix it.
0116_103	Rachel	 (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
0116_104	Ross	 (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
0116_105	Chandler	 (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
0116_106	<event>	Rachel slowly spins around, finally noticing that the lights have outstayed their welcome.
0116_107	Monica	 Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
0116_108	Rachel	 Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monicas note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
0116_109	<event>	Joey enters, looking extremely pleased with himself.
0116_110	Chandler	 Hey, where you been?
0116_111	Joey	 I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt t and four plates of curly fries.
0116_112	Chandler	 Score.
0116_113	Joey	 She is so hot!
0116_114	Chandler	 Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
0116_115	Joey	 Pheebs?
0116_116	Phoebe	 (Jumping up) Yeah?
0116_117	Joey	 You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
0116_118	Phoebe	 Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
0116_119	Joey	 So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.

0116_121	Joey	 Cool, thanks.
0116_122	<event>	He happily gestures at Chandler that there was nothing to worry about, then exits. Rachel and Monica are concerned for poor Phoebe, who slides back down next to Ross.
0116_123	Ross	 You okay?
0116_124	Phoebe	 Yeah Im fine.
0116_125	Ross	 You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
0116_126	<event>	The sitcom begins with its familiar refrain, yet with a Latin lilt. Rachel and Monica do a little dance with their chopsticks, and Phoebe has to grin as Ross joins in the rhythm.
0116_127	<scene>	Lamaze class. Susan is there. Each couple has a doll, for they have just finished learning how to change a diaper. As Ross rushes in, stepping on the Rostins pretend baby, squashing its head flat. It bleats, in protest. He performs emergency surgery, then hands the doll back to J.C.
0116_128	Ross	 Sorry.
0116_129	Ross	 Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
0116_130	Susan	 Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. Ill get the information.

0116_136	Susan	 I am supposed to be the mommy?
0116_137	Ross	 Okay, Im gonna play my sperm card one more time.
0116_138	Susan	 Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because Im a woman.
0116_139	Ross	 I see. So what do you propose to do?
0116_140	Susan	 I will flip you for it.
0116_141	Ross	 Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
0116_142	Susan	 (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.
0116_143	<event>	Ross gets down like all the other mothers, cradled in Susans lap like all the other fathers.
0116_144	Teacher	 Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
0116_145	<event>	Forgetting herself, Susan does the "Mommy" action with Ross.
0116_146	Teacher	 Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
0116_147	<event>	Ross comes out of character to glare into the distance.
0116_148	<scene>	Chandler's Office. Chandler is playing with a toy as his boss Mr. Douglas knocks and opens the door.
0116_149	Chandler	 Mr. D, hows it going, sir?

0116_151	Chandler	 And?

0116_160	Nina	 Are you okay?
0116_161	Chandler	 (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
0116_162	Nina	 (Taking her hand away) What?
0116_163	Chandler	 (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
0116_164	<event>	Nina gasps in surprise and relief.
0116_165	<scene>	Central Perk, Rachel is at the counter, serving coffee to Phoebe.
0116_166	Rachel	 So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
0116_167	Phoebe	 Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
0116_168	Rachel	 Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn ?
0116_169	Phoebe	 Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
0116_170	Rachel	 Ooh, okay... good.

0116_174	<event>	Jamie notices Phoebe sitting at the counter.
0116_175	Jamie	 I think we have an answer.
0116_176	Fran	 Whats she doing here?
0116_177	Jamie	 This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home.
0116_178	Fran	 Think she got fired at Riffs?
0116_179	Jamie	 No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory) ..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?

0116_192	Jamie	 All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
0116_193	Fran	 And some biscottie cookies.

0116_204	Chandler	 Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
0116_205	Rachel	 Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. (Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?"
0116_206	<event>	Joey lets himself in, carrying a large paper shopping bag.
0116_207	Joey	 Hey.
0116_208	Rachel And Chandler	 Hey.
0116_209	<event>	There is a loud knocking at the door through which Joey has just entered.
0116_210	Chandler	 You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
0116_211	Monica	 Ill get it.
0116_212	<event>	She rises, dragging Chandler along by the wool. Rachel has to leap over a chair to follow them. Monica opens the door to find Mr. Heckles standing there.

0116_222	Joey	 Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
0116_223	Phoebe	 Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...
0116_224	Joey	 Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
0116_225	Phoebe	 Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.

0116_227	Rachel	 Are you seein her again tonight?
0116_228	Joey	 Yep. Ice Capades.

0116_232	<event>	The circle freezes in apprehension.
0116_233	Joey	 Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
0116_234	Phoebe	 Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
0116_235	Joey	 Okay... Well maybe now Im not okay with it not being okay.

0116_243	Nina	 Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.
0116_244	<event>	She escapes, fortunately so distracting Mr. Douglas, that he misses Chandlers expression of alarm & guilt.
0116_245	Mr. Douglas	 (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Ninas shapely departure) Shes still here.
0116_246	Chandler	 Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
0116_247	<event>	Thinking quickly, Chandler desperately tries to remember anything to do with schizophrenia....
0116_248	Chandler	 And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
0116_249	Mr. Douglas	 Youre kidding? She seems so...
0116_250	Chandler	 Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
0116_251	Mr. Douglas	 Thats unbelievable.
0116_252	Chandler	 And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
0116_253	Mr. Douglas	 I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
0116_254	Chandler	 Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
0116_255	<event>	Mr. Douglas screws up his eyes, trying to credit what Bing has just said, but turning to follow Nina down the corridor, he realises Bing must be telling the truth, since he would not have any personal interest in the girl, would he?

0116_260	Ross	 Susan, go deep.
0116_261	<event>	Susan just glares back, as Rosss inappropriate joke falls flat. Meanwhile, a bubble is about to burst...
0116_262	Carol	 This is impossible. Its just impossible.
0116_263	Susan	 What is, honey?
0116_264	Carol	 What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in .
0116_265	Ross	 Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
0116_266	Carol	 (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it ?"
0116_267	Susan	 Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
0116_268	<event>	Both women gulp in air. Ross looks at his "football," then manipulates the head & limbs back into place, until it resembles what it represents.
0116_269	Susan	 I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.

0116_275	Ross	 I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
0116_276	Rachel	 (She comforts him too) Oh, youre gonna be great!
0116_277	Ross	 Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
0116_278	Chandler	 You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.

0116_293	Chandler	 Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
0116_294	Nina	 I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
0116_295	Chandler	 Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
0116_296	Nina	 Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
0116_297	Chandler	 Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
0116_298	Nina	 I am?
0116_299	Chandler	 Sure, why not?
0116_300	Nina	 Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) Youre amazing!
0116_301	Chandler	 Oh, you dont know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
0116_302	Helen	 (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?

0116_309	Chandler	 Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
0116_310	Monica	 Okay, I think I get how to do this.
0116_311	<event>	Monica points the remote at her TV, and punches out a key combination from the book, but the dreaded SAP logo remains and Spanish still comes forth.
0116_312	Phoebe	 Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
0116_313	Monica	 (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.

0116_316	Phoebe	 Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
0116_317	Rachel	 Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
0116_318	Phoebe	 Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff . When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
0116_319	Monica And Rachel	 (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No.
0116_320	Phoebe	 Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
0116_321	Rachel	 Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
0116_322	Phoebe	 I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
0116_323	Chandler	 Youre not gonna lose him.
0116_324	Monica	 Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
0116_325	Phoebe	 Yeah. Okay.
0116_326	Ross	 No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
0116_327	Phoebe	 But hes falling in love with her.
0116_328	Rachel	 Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.

0116_339	Rachel	 No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)

0116_344	Mr.Heckles	 See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
0221_001	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is there. Monica is watching stock prices on a business channel.
0221_002	Joey	 Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?
0221_003	Monica	 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
0221_004	Rachel	 Ok honey, you really need a job.
0221_005	Ross	 Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
0221_006	Monica	 Really.
0221_007	Phoebe	 Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.
0221_008	Ross	 On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
0221_009	Phoebe	 No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
0221_010	Everyone	 Ahh.
0221_011	Phoebe	 And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
0221_012	Monica	 His indian name?
0221_013	Phoebe	 No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
0221_014	Ross	 Freakish.
0221_015	Monica	 Wow.
0221_016	Joey	 Freaky.
0221_017	Monica	 Weird, weird.
0221_018	Rachel	 Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?
0221_019	Phoebe	 Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.
0221_020	Monica	 Why?

0221_031	Little Bully	 [walks back from the counter] Hey, we were sitting there.
0221_032	Chandler	 Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
0221_033	Little Bully	 Is that supposed to be funny?
0221_034	Chandler	 No actually, I was just going for colorful.
0221_035	Big Bully	 What's with this guy?
0221_036	Little Bully	 What's with you?
0221_037	Ross	 Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.
0221_038	<scene>	as they're walking off, little bully grabs Chandlers hat from behind and puts it on himself
0221_039	Chandler	 What just happened?
0221_040	Little Bully	 I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
0221_041	Chandler	 That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
0221_042	Little Bully	 No.
0221_043	Chandler	 No?
0221_044	Big Bully	 No.
0221_045	Ross	 Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
0221_046	Big Bully	 Why should we?
0221_047	Ross	 Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
0221_048	Chandler	 Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
0221_049	Big Bully	 You got a problem with that?
0221_050	Chandler	 No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
0221_051	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting there and Monica walks in.
0221_052	Rachel	 Hey, how'd the interview go?
0221_053	Monica	 It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
0221_054	Rachel	 So don't do it.
0221_055	Monica	 How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
0221_056	Joey	 Monica, relax, go get a beer.
0221_057	Monica	 I don't want a beer.
0221_058	Joey	 Who said it was for you?
0221_059	Ross And Chandler	 [both enter looking down] Hhhiiii.
0221_060	Rachel	 What's the matter with you?
0221_061	Chandler	 The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
0221_062	Rachel	 Noo.
0221_063	Joey	 You're kiddin'.
0221_064	Ross	 It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
0221_065	Rachel	 Oohhh.
0221_066	Ross	 Hi.
0221_067	Rachel	 Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]
0221_068	Chandler	 Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
0221_069	Joey	 Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.
0221_070	Chandler	 Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
0221_071	Monica	 [seeing TV] Hey, I went up.
0221_072	Rachel	 What?
0221_073	Monica	 My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
0221_074	Joey	 Do what?
0221_075	Monica	 Put all my money in me.
0221_076	Rachel	 Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.

0221_087	Joey	 Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
0221_088	Rachel	 No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
0221_089	Phoebe	 [a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.

0221_100	Phoebe	 Are you crazy?
0221_101	Joey	 Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.
0221_102	<scene>	Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting at the couch.
0221_103	Chandler	 Hey.

0221_107	Big Bully	 Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
0221_108	Little Bully	 And look where they're sitting.
0221_109	Ross	 You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
0221_110	Big Bully	 Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
0221_111	Little Bully	 Yeah.
0221_112	Big Bully	 This couch belongs to us.
0221_113	Chandler	 Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
0221_114	Big Bully	 You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
0221_115	Ross	 Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.
0221_116	Gunther	 Fellas, these guys were here first.
0221_117	Big Bully	 Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
0221_118	Little Bully	 Sorry.
0221_119	Gunther	 There you go.
0221_120	Ross	 Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
0221_121	Little Bully	 He told on us?
0221_122	Big Bully	 You told on us?
0221_123	Ross	 Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]
0221_124	Chandler	 Don't play with his things.
0221_125	Ross	 I know.
0221_126	Big Bully	 Alright, let's take this outside.
0221_127	Ross	 Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
0221_128	Big Bully	 The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
0221_129	Chandler	 You had to ask.
0221_130	Ross	 Yeah.
0221_131	<scene>	the bullies grab the back of the couch that Ross and Chandler are sitting in and tip back
0221_132	Ross	 Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.
0221_133	Little Bully	 Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
0221_134	Chandler	 I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
0221_135	<scene>	Back in the cab in front of Phoebe's dad's house.
0221_136	Joey	 Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
0221_137	Phoebe	 Yeah, I don't know.
0221_138	Rachel	 What's the matter?
0221_139	Phoebe	 I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
0221_140	Rachel	 Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
0221_141	Joey	 Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
0221_142	Phoebe	 Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
0221_143	<scene>	She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.
0221_144	Phoebe	 [innocently] What was that?
0221_145	Joey	 Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
0221_146	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten up, and Monica is on the phone.
0221_147	Monica	 I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
0221_148	Rachel	 Time is money my friend?
0221_149	Joey	 Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
0221_150	Monica	 Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
0221_151	Joey	 Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
0221_152	Rachel	 How did you make $17.
0221_153	Monica	 Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
0221_154	Joey	 How come those?
0221_155	Monica	 Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
0221_156	Rachel	 What happened to uh, MEG.?
0221_157	Monica	 MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.
0221_158	Joey	 That is so not my motto.
0221_159	Phoebe	 [enters] Hey.
0221_160	Rachel	 Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
0221_161	Phoebe	 Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
0221_162	Joey	 Good.
0221_163	Rachel	 Oh, thank God.
0221_164	Phoebe	 Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
0221_165	Rachel	 Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
0221_166	Phoebe	 I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
0221_167	Joey	 Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
0221_168	Phoebe	 Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]
0221_169	Monica	 DON'T ...be too long with the phone.
0221_170	Rachel	 She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
0221_171	Joey	 [dials the phone] It's a woman.
0221_172	Phoebe	 So talk to her.
0221_173	Joey	 [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]
0221_174	Rachel	 Why the voice.
0221_175	Joey	 [in the voice] Hard to say.

0221_180	Chandler	 Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
0221_181	Ross	 Absolutely.
0221_182	<scene>	they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs
0221_183	Ross	 How come it's not mixing with the water?
0221_184	Chandler	Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
0221_185	<scene>	they both try to drink while continuously stirring
0221_186	Joey	 [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
0221_187	Chandler	 Ok.
0221_188	Ross	 No.
0221_189	Chandler	 No?
0221_190	Ross	 No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
0221_191	Chandler	 Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
0221_192	Joey	 Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
0221_193	Ross	 Yeah, sure.
0221_194	Joey	 By someone besides Monica?
0221_195	Ross	 No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.

0221_201	Rachel	 For what?
0221_202	Monica	 I've gotta get back in the game.
0221_203	Rachel	 Why, when did you get out of the game?
0221_204	Monica	 I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
0221_205	Rachel	 Oh no.

0221_209	Rachel	 I, I don't have it.
0221_210	Monica	 But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.
0221_211	Rachel	 Nobody does honey.
0221_212	<scene>	Phoebe's dad's house. Phoebe is returning the dog who is bandaged up and has a plastic cone around it's neck.
0221_213	Phoebe	 Hi.
0221_214	Mrs Buffay	 Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
0221_215	Phoebe	 It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.
0221_216	Mrs Buffay	 What are these, stitches?
0221_217	Phoebe	 Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
0221_218	Mrs Buffay	 Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
0221_219	Phoebe	 Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
0221_220	Mrs Buffay	 How do you know Frank?
0221_221	Phoebe	 Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
0221_222	Mrs Buffay	 Yeah. Frank.
0221_223	Frank	 Yeah. What? [a young guy comes around the corner]
0221_224	Phoebe	 Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
0221_225	Mrs Buffay	 He went out for groceries.
0221_226	Phoebe	 Ok so will he be back soon?
0221_227	Mrs Buffay	 Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
0221_228	Phoebe	 Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
0221_229	<scene>	she turns to leave, Frank follows
0221_230	Frank	 Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
0221_231	Phoebe	 Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
0221_232	Frank	 Heavy.
0221_233	Phoebe	 Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
0221_234	Frank	 No but he didn't really talk about anything.
0221_235	Phoebe	 Oh.
0221_236	Frank	 Except stilts.
0221_237	Phoebe	 Stilts?
0221_238	Frank	 Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.
0221_239	Phoebe	 Wow.
0221_240	Frank	 Yeah.
0221_241	Phoebe	 I don't know what to do with that.
0221_242	Frank	 Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
0221_243	Phoebe	 Yeah.
0221_244	Frank	 This is huge, you can buy me beer.
0221_245	Phoebe	 I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
0221_246	Frank	 I gotta friend named Mark.
0221_247	Phoebe	 That'll work too.
0221_248	Frank	 Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.
0221_249	Phoebe	 Yeah, that'd be ok.
0221_250	Frank	 Alright.
0221_251	Phoebe	 Ok, I'm in the book.
0221_252	Frank	 Ok, yeah.
0221_253	Phoebe	 Alright. So um, stilts huh?
0221_254	Frank	 Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
0221_255	Phoebe	 Ok.

0221_257	Ross	 Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?
0221_258	Chandler	 Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.
0221_259	<scene>	They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and gulp down a few drinks
0221_260	Chandler	 Ah, there we go.
0221_261	Ross	 I think we proved our point.
0221_262	Chandler	 You burn your mouth?
0221_263	Ross	 Cannot feel my tounge.
0221_264	<scene>	They leave. As they're walking out, the bullies are walking in.
0221_265	Chandler	 Bullies, big bullies.
0221_266	Little Bully	 Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
0221_267	Big Bully	 Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
0221_268	Ross	 Yes, and that's why we're here.
0221_269	Chandler	 Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
0221_270	Little Bully	 Let's do this alright.
0221_271	Ross	 Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
0221_272	Little Bully	 It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
0221_273	Chandler	 Alright, let's do this.
0221_274	Little Bully	 Alright.
0221_275	<scene>	they all put up their fists and prepare to fight
0221_276	Chandler	 Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
0221_277	Ross	 Whad'ya mean?
0221_278	Chandler	 Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
0221_279	Big Bully	 No, you can't use your watch.
0221_280	Chandler	 Ok. [reaches in his pocket]
0221_281	Big Bully	 Or your keys.
0221_282	Chandler	 Ok.
0221_283	Little Bully	 Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box] Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
0221_284	<scene>	they all jump in the street and prepare to fight
0221_285	Ross	 Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
0221_286	Big Bully	 Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
0221_287	Ross	 Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
0221_288	Little Bully	 Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
0221_289	Big Bully	 Ok, nothing from the neck up. [everyone gets ready for the fight] Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating.
0221_290	Little Bully	 Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
0221_291	Big Bully	 Yeah.
0221_292	Chandler	 Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
0221_293	Big Bully	 C'MON!
0221_294	Ross	 Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.

0221_298	<scene>	they all run off after the guy
0221_299	<scene>	Central Perk. The four guys are returning after getting the hat back.
0221_300	Ross	 God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.

0221_302	Ross	 Yeah he was wasn't he.
0221_303	Chandler	 Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
0221_304	Big Bully	 Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
0221_305	Ross	 So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
0221_306	Little Bully	 We're ok.
0221_307	Ross	 Alright.
0221_308	Chandler	 Ok so, can I have my hat back?
0221_309	Little Bully	 No.
0221_310	Chandler	 Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch]
0221_312	<scene>	The 50's theme cafe. Monica is working the grill, the rest are at a table.
0221_313	Rachel	 Look at her.
0221_314	Chandler	 Hi Monica.
0221_315	Joey	 He-he-he, how's it goin'?
0221_316	Phoebe	 Hey nice boobs.
0221_317	Chandler	 Guys guys, check this out.
0221_318	<scene>	Chandler puts a coin in the mini jukebox at the table. YMCA starts playing and Monica and the rest of the staff have to get on the counter and start singing along and dancing. After a couple of couruses, Chandler pulls out a handful of coins and drops them on the table.
0221_319	Joey	 Excellent.
0320_001	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Joey are there.
0320_002	Chandler	 Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
0320_003	Joey	 Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what its like to be you?
0320_004	Monica	 Wow, youre really crazy about her, huh?
0320_005	Joey	 Oh, you have no idea. And-and when were on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and its like somebodys ripping out my heart!
0320_006	Phoebe	 Oh, its so great to see you feeling like this!
0320_007	Ross	 (entering) Hey!
0320_008	All	 Hey!
0320_009	Ross	 Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
0320_010	Monica	 Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
0320_011	Ross	 We were all pretty shaken up about it.
0320_012	Phoebe	 Wait, am I missing something though? Cause I thought death was something thats supposed to be sad, in a way.
0320_013	Ross	 Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
0320_014	Monica	 Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And Im sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
0320_015	Ross	 You get the dollhouse.
0320_016	Monica	 I get the dollhouse!
0320_017	Phoebe	 Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
0320_018	Joey	 Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
0320_019	Phoebe	 No, just a barrel.
0320_020	Monica	 Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
0320_021	Phoebe	 Really?! Really?!
0320_022	Monica	 Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
0320_023	Chandler	 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
0320_025	<scene>	Rachels office, Chandler and her are coming back from lunch.
0320_026	Rachel	 Hey, Sophie!
0320_027	Sophie	 Hey, Rach!
0320_028	Chandler	 Hey.
0320_029	Sophie	 Hey.
0320_030	Rachel	 Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all the way back up here.
0320_031	Chandler	 Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
0320_032	Rachel	 Honey um, honey, you do realise that we dont keep the womens lingerie here in the office?
0320_033	Chandler	 Yes, I realise that.
0320_034	Rachel	 Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
0320_035	Chandler	 Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
0320_036	<scene>	Rachels boss, Joanna, enters
0320_037	Joanna	 Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You dont work for me.
0320_038	Rachel	 (introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.
0320_039	Joanna	 Bing! Thats a great name.
0320_040	Chandler	 Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done. So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
0320_041	Joanna	 Me too.
0320_042	Rachel	 Bye, Chandler.
0320_043	Joanna	 (to Rachel) So ah, whats wrong with him?
0320_044	Rachel	 Oh, nothing, hes just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
0320_045	Joanna	 Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
0320_046	Rachel	 No!! No! Hes not married, or involved, with anyone!
0320_047	Joanna	 Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.
0320_048	Rachel	 Well, Ill ask him for you, if you want me too?
0320_049	Joanna	 Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
0320_050	Sophie	 Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
0320_051	Joanna	 I know that.
0320_052	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica is showing off her new dollhouse. Its a huge dollhouse, that takes up the entire living room table.
0320_053	Monica	 Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
0320_054	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
0320_055	Chandler	 Hello.
0320_056	Phoebe	 Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
0320_057	Monica	 I know!!!
0320_058	Phoebe	 So, Im here, ready to play.
0320_059	Monica	 Okay.
0320_060	Phoebe	 I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
0320_061	Monica	 Whats this?
0320_062	Phoebe	 Thats a dog, every house should have a dog.
0320_063	Monica	 Not one that can pee on the roof.
0320_064	Phoebe	 Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
0320_065	Chandler	 (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
0320_066	Phoebe	 No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.
0320_067	Monica	 I dont want a ghost.
0320_068	Phoebe	 Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
0320_069	Ross	 Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
0320_070	Phoebe	 Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.
0320_071	Rachel	 (entering) Hey!
0320_072	All	 Hello.
0320_073	Rachel	 I need to talk to you!
0320_074	Ross	 Sure, whats up?
0320_075	Rachel	 Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
0320_076	Ross	 I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
0320_077	Chandler	 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
0320_078	Rachel	 Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
0320_079	Chandler	 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin out the Chan-Chan man!
0320_080	Rachel	 (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
0320_081	Chandler	 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.
0320_082	Rachel	 Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, shes gonna love me.
0320_083	Phoebe	 (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
0320_084	Monica	 Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-thats it, thats it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? Theyre not the right size, theyre not Victorian, and they just dont go.
0320_085	Phoebe	 Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, were not welcome in the house of no imagination.
0320_086	Ross	 Uh, Pheebs, while were hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they dont go, rrroof!
0320_087	Phoebe	 The little ones do.
0320_088	<scene>	The Theatre, Joey and Kate are getting ready to rehearse the play.
0320_089	Joey	 Hey, Kate!
0320_090	Kate	 Morning.
0320_091	Joey	 Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
0320_092	The Director	 Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)
0320_093	Joey	 (to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
0320_094	Woman	 Hi, oh, Im Lauren, Kates understudy.
0320_095	Joey	 Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
0320_096	Lauren	 I know! I-Im a big fan of yours.
0320_097	Joey	 (looks at her, shocked) What?!
0320_098	Lauren	 I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives .
0320_099	Joey	 Get out of here, really?!
0320_100	Lauren	 Absolutely!
0320_101	Joey	 Yeah?
0320_102	Lauren	 Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
0320_103	Joey	 They gave me the shaft all right.
0320_104	Lauren	 (laughing) Oh, youre so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
0320_105	Joey	 Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
0320_106	Lauren	 Cool! I-Ill see you then.
0320_107	Joey	 All right.
0320_108	The Director	 All right, its time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and Kate just look at each other.)
0320_109	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering with her own dollhouse, that she made herself.
0320_110	Phoebe	 Hey!
0320_111	All	 Hey!
0320_112	Phoebe	 Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
0320_113	Rachel	 Wow!!
0320_114	Phoebe	 Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
0320_115	Ross	 Hey, whats this?!
0320_116	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, its the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)
0320_117	Monica	 Its very interesting, Phoebe.
0320_118	Rachel	 Whats this?
0320_119	Phoebe	 The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
0320_120	Ross	 This is the coolest house ever!!
0320_121	<event>	Monica is looking on with a hurt expression on her face.
0320_122	Phoebe	 Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
0320_123	Rachel	 All right!
0320_124	Ross	 I would!
0320_125	Monica	 Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
0320_126	Ross And Rachel	 Uh-huh.
0320_127	Phoebe	 Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)
0320_128	Ross And Rachel	 Ooohhhh!!
0320_129	Phoebe	 And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
0320_130	Ross And Rachel	 Ahhhh!!
0320_131	Chandler	 (entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!
0320_132	Rachel	 (to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
0320_133	Chandler	 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
0320_134	Rachel	 Hmm.
0320_135	Chandler	 Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a big, dull dud !
0320_136	<scene>	Rachels office, Joannas telling Rachel, her side of the story.
0320_137	Joanna	 Chandler is fantastic!!
0320_138	Rachel	 What?!
0320_139	Joanna	 Oh God, we just clicked! Yknow how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
0320_140	Rachel	 Oh, I....
0320_141	Joanna	 Oh, and hes got such a good heart! Doesnt he have a good heart?
0320_142	Rachel	 Oh, I know...
0320_143	Joanna	 Oh, I know and hes soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
0320_144	Sophie	 Isnt this great?!
0320_145	Joanna	 Dont spoil it.
0320_146	<scene>	The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing.
0320_147	Joey	 Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?
0320_148	<scene>	A phone rings.
0320_149	The Director	 (answering the phone) Hello. Oh! Its you. Just ah, just one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment ! (He goes to take the call.)
0320_150	Joey	 (to Kate) That guys like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
0320_151	Kate	 He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater youre dating.
0320_152	Joey	 Hey, Im not interested in her sweater! Its whats underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who Im going out with?
0320_153	Kate	 I dont care. Why, do you want me to care?
0320_154	Joey	 Do you want me to want you to care?
0320_155	Kate	 Do you?
0320_156	Joey	 What?
0320_157	The Director	 (returning) Okay, Im afraid to say this, but lets pick it up where we left off.
0320_158	<scene>	They resume rehearsing.
0320_159	Joey	 Come on baby, dont go. Please? What do you say?
0320_160	Kate	 Ive got no reason to stay.
0320_161	<event>	Joey grabs her and kisses her.
0320_162	The Director	 Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! Ill see you in the morning. (exits)
0320_163	Kate	 I cant believe we go on in, in a week.
0320_164	Joey	 Hey, its gonna be all right.
0320_165	Lauren	 (to Joey) Hey! So since were getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
0320_166	Joey	 What?
0320_167	Lauren	 You know! At the place I told you about last night?
0320_168	Joey	 Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
0320_169	Lauren	 Oh, okay.
0320_170	Joey	 Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
0320_171	Lauren	 Ill see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)
0320_172	Joey	 Okay.
0320_173	Lauren	 Gnight. (exits)
0320_174	Joey	 (to Kate) Ah, are you okay?
0320_175	Kate	 Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
0320_176	Joey	 I dont know.
0320_177	Kate	 Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
0320_178	Joey	 How do you mean?
0320_179	Kate	 Well, Adrians looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor cant just kiss her, hes gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
0320_180	Joey	 Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
0320_181	Kate	 Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
0320_182	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
0320_183	Kate	 And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
0320_184	Joey	 And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
0320_185	Kate	 And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
0320_186	<scene>	cut to Joeys bedroom, Joey and Kate are emerging from under the covers.
0320_187	Joey	 Something like that?
0320_188	Kate	 Yeah, thats pretty much what I had in mind.
0320_189	Joey	 Yeah.
0320_191	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are eating breakfast as Joey enters, very happily.
0320_192	Joey	 (to Ross) Hey.
0320_193	Ross	 Hi.
0320_194	Joey	 (to Monica) Hey.
0320_195	<event>	He walks up behind Monica and gives her a big hug and a kiss on the neck.
0320_196	Ross	 Hi.
0320_197	Joey	 Hey.
0320_198	<event>	He walks over behind Ross, thinks about it for a moment, and gives him a big hug.
0320_199	Ross	 Its a little early to be drinkin.
0320_200	Joey	 No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
0320_201	Ross	 Ohhhhh!
0320_202	Monica	 Youre kidding?! Thats great!
0320_203	Joey	 Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...
0320_204	Monica	 Oh my.
0320_205	Joey	 Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like hes been processed by the devil, or something.)
0320_206	Chandler	 (entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call.
0320_207	Rachel	 Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?
0320_208	Chandler	 Thats what you say at the end of a date.
0320_209	Rachel	 You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?
0320_210	Chandler	 To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.
0320_211	Monica	 Come on Rach, when a guy says hes going to call, it doesnt mean hes going to call. Hasnt it ever happened to you?
0320_212	Rachel	 Well, they always called.
0320_213	Monica	 Hmm, bite me.
0320_214	<scene>	Rachels office.
0320_215	Joanna	 (entering) Did he call?
0320_216	Rachel	 No. Sorry.
0320_217	Joanna	 Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?
0320_218	Sophie	 Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
0320_219	Joanna	 Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?
0320_220	Rachel	 Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
0320_221	Joanna	 Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
0320_222	Rachel	 Well...
0320_223	Joanna	 The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?
0320_224	Rachel	 No. I...
0320_225	Joanna	 Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
0320_226	<scene>	Central Perk, Chandler is reading a magazine as Rachel approaches.
0320_227	Rachel	 (grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
0320_228	Chandler	 Multiple, so many paper cuts.
0320_229	Rachel	 Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand. Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy!
0320_230	Chandler	 (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
0320_231	Rachel	 Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you havent called her. You have to call her!
0320_232	Chandler	 Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
0320_233	Rachel	 Well then youre going to have to take her out again.
0320_234	Chandler	 Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
0320_235	Rachel	 I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
0320_236	Chandler	 All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
0320_237	Rachel	 Thats fine!
0320_238	Chandler	 Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
0320_239	Rachel	 I know.
0320_240	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.
0320_241	Ross	 Mon?
0320_242	Monica	 (from the bathroom) Im in the shower!
0320_243	<scene>	He closes the door and walks over to get something from the fridge. He starts to smell something and turns around to see Phoebes dollhouse smoking. He runs over and takes off the roof to reveal that the dollhouse fire.
0320_244	Ross	 Oh, fire! There, theres a fire! Fire!!
0320_245	<scene>	He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesnt work. He runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesnt work. He then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica scream at the top of her lungs.
0320_246	<scene>	The Theatre, Kate is arriving for rehearsal.
0320_247	Joey	 Hey.
0320_248	Kate	 Hi.
0320_249	Joey	 So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
0320_250	Kate	 About what?
0320_251	Joey	 Y'know, about what happened with us.
0320_252	Kate	 Nooo. And theres really no reason he should find out, so ah lets not make a big deal about it, okay?
0320_253	Joey	 What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you cant tell me last night didnt mean something to you. I-I was there, youre not that good an actress.
0320_254	Kate	 Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. Thats all it was. Joey, Im-Im sorry you feel bad, but havent you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
0320_255	Joey	 Nooo.
0320_256	Lauren	 (entering) Hi, Kate!
0320_257	Kate	 Hi, Lauren.
0320_258	Joey	 Hi, Lauren.
0320_259	Lauren	 Hi, pig!
0320_260	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Ross are inspecting the damage to the dollhouse.
0320_261	Ross	 Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
0320_262	Monica	 Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
0320_263	Ross	 Yeah.
0320_264	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
0320_265	Monica	 (runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
0320_266	Phoebe	 What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!
0320_267	Ross	 Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
0320_268	Phoebe	 All right. Did everyone get out okay?
0320_269	Monica	 Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
0320_270	Phoebe	 Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)
0320_271	Ross	 No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
0320_272	Phoebe	 (She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
0320_273	<event>	She picks up a charred piece of plastic that once was the Foster puppets, and starts to break down. Monica goes over and comforts her.
0320_274	<scene>	Rachels office, Chandler and Joanna are returning from their lunch date. He is telling her about her mascara problem. Rachel is already there.
0320_275	Chandler	 Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here, (points to his eye) and its all the time.
0320_276	Joanna	 Well, thanks again for lunch.
0320_277	Chandler	 (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.
0320_278	<event>	Rachel is slowing trying to leave and let them talk.
0320_279	Joanna	 It was, wasnt it?
0320_280	Chandler	 The food there was, was great.
0320_281	Joanna	 Wasnt it?
0320_282	Chandler	 So take care.
0320_283	Joanna	 You too.
0320_284	Chandler	 Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
0320_285	Joanna	 Great! Im looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
0320_286	Rachel	 Sophies desk.
0320_287	<event>	Chandler starts to leave ashamed of himself, but Rachel stops him in the hallway.
0320_288	Rachel	 (whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
0320_289	Chandler	 Noo!
0320_290	Rachel	 Chandler!!
0320_291	Chandler	 Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
0320_292	Rachel	 Okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
0320_293	Chandler	 AhhhhIm not going to call you.
0320_294	Joanna	 What?
0320_295	Chandler	 Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And Im really sorry, its just that this is not, this isnt going to work out.
0320_296	Joanna	 Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
0320_297	Chandler	 Yeah, o-okay.
0320_298	Joanna	 So...
0320_299	Chandler	 Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
0320_300	<event>	Rachel is shocked, and holds her arms out in disbelief.
0320_302	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Joey is talking on the phone.
0320_303	Joey	 (on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, shes not home huh? (listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
0325_001	<scene>	Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe is there. Bonnie is telling them of her sex-capades.
0325_002	Chandler	 (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
0325_003	Bonnie	 All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out.
0325_004	Chandler	 Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
0325_005	<scene>	cut to Rachel and Monica at the counter.
0325_006	Rachel	 (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
0325_007	Joey	 Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
0325_008	Monica	 Joey, she was listing the countries shes done it in.
0325_009	Joey	 Well, I think we all learned something.
0325_010	Phoebe	 (entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) Thats my Moms writing! Look.
0325_011	Chandler	 (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
0325_012	Phoebe	 Y'know what that means?
0325_013	Joey	 That youre actually 50?
0325_014	Phoebe	 No-no, thats not, thats not me Phoebe, thats her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
0325_015	All	 Oh!
0325_016	Rachel	 That is so cool.
0325_017	Phoebe	 I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
0325_018	All	 Yeah! Yeah, we can!
0325_019	Bonnie	 (to Ross) Shoot! I cant go, I have to work!
0325_020	Ross	 Thats too bad.
0325_021	Rachel	 (sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
0325_022	Phoebe	 So great! Okay! Tomorrow were gonna drive out to Montauk.
0325_023	Joey	 Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
0325_024	<event>	Rachel turns and gives him a look, and Joey quickly apologises.
0325_026	<scene>	Outside Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are waiting for Phoebe to arrive with the cab.
0325_027	Monica	 (watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
0325_028	Chandler	 Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
0325_029	Monica	 (sarcastic) Thanks!
0325_030	Chandler	 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.
0325_031	<event>	At that suggestion Monica starts laughing.
0325_032	Monica	 Yeah right.
0325_033	Chandler	 Why is that so funny?
0325_034	Monica	 You made a joke right? So I laughed.
0325_035	Chandler	 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
0325_036	Monica	 Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
0325_037	Chandler	 Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your door, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
0325_038	Monica	 Well Id probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
0325_039	Joey	 (walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
0325_040	Monica	 Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
0325_041	Joey	 No, its just my luggage.
0325_042	<event>	Phoebe drives up.
0325_043	Chandler, Monica, And Joey	 Hey!!
0325_044	Joey	 Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
0325_045	Phoebe	 Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
0325_046	Ross	 Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
0325_047	Phoebe	 Oh, I wasnt talking about his karma.
0325_048	Rachel	 (approaching) Hey!
0325_049	Chandler	 Hey!
0325_050	Joey	 Hey-hey, check out the hat!
0325_051	<event>	She is wearing this giant straw hat, the brim on it must be at least, least foot wide.
0325_052	Chandler	 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!!
0325_053	Monica	 Seriously, where did you get the hat?
0325_054	Rachel	 Ross gave it to me.
0325_055	Ross	 Yeah, I think she looks good.
0325_056	Rachel	 Ohh, thank you.
0325_057	Chandler	 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
0325_058	Rachel	 Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
0325_059	Phoebe	 And this time, theyve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
0325_060	<scene>	At the Beach, its raining cats and dogs as the gang arrives. Chandler and Monica are taking shelter under Rachels hat.

0325_090	Phoebe	 (happily) Yeah, no, it was great.

0325_115	<event>	They get into a wrestling match, that ends with Ross making Rachel paint her forehead with the nail polish. They both end up lying next to each other, stop, and look at each other for a moment.

0325_288	<event>	She starts walking across the darkened room and hits her head on a wind chime hanging from the ceiling, to stop it from making a noise she grabs it and Shhhs it. She goes into the kitchen and finds Phoebe Sr.s appointment book, to read it she opens the freezer. Just as she starts to read, Phoebe Sr. jumps out from her bedroom with a coat hanger, startling Phoebe.
0325_289	Phoebe	 No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!
0325_290	Phoebe Sr	 Then don't break in!!

0325_318	Ross	 Hey, itll grow back, right? And she-shes really fun, and shes cool, and-and Im finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and Im finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesnt work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?

0410_044	Monica	 I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation.
0410_045	Chandler	 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss.

0410_111	Ross	 You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
0410_112	Chandler	 Yeah.
0410_113	Ross	 Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them. Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes not fun.
0410_114	Phoebe	 If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
0410_115	Ross	 Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
0410_116	Joey	 (entering) Hey!

0410_132	Chandler	 Well, like father, like son.
0410_133	Rachel	 Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
0410_134	Chandler	 Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
0410_135	Rachel	 Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
0410_136	Chandler	 Ummmmmmmm, no.
0410_137	Rachel	 You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
0410_138	Chandler	 Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
0410_139	Rachel	 Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
0410_140	<scene>	Allesandros, Joey is eating some cheese.
0410_141	Monica	 Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
0410_142	Joey	 Yeah. Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey. Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
0410_143	A Waiter	 (entering) Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday. (hands him two envelopes)
0410_144	Joey	 (opening an envelope) Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!
0410_145	The Waiter	 Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
0410_146	Monica	 Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?
0410_147	The Waiter	 Because we can remember them.
0410_148	Monica	 Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
0410_149	The Waiter	 Well, sure, that too.
0410_150	Monica	 Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right heres the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere
0410_151	The Waiter	 Cant hear you!
0410_152	Monica	 (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money hes holding, and doesnt speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
0410_153	Joey	 No maam.
0410_154	The Waiter	 Hey! He has a name, its Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)
0410_156	<scene>	Allesandros, continued from earlier. The other waiters are gone and Monica is confronting Joey about his not speaking up.
0410_157	Monica	 What the hell happened?!
0410_158	Joey	 I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! Its been a long time since I had (tries to do the math in his head, but cant) 327 + 238 dollars!"
0410_159	Monica	 Joey, we had a deal. That-thats why youre here! Ive got to fire you!
0410_160	Joey	 And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You dont fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyll start listening to all the nice things Ive been saying about you.
0410_161	Monica	 What kinda things have you been saying?
0410_162	Joey	 Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.

0410_171	Chandler	 Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?
0410_172	Ross	 The one with the cat. I gotta go, Ive got another date.
0410_173	Phoebe	 So, did you pick one yet?
0410_174	Ross	 No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thoughtit wasnt that funny. So Im still torn.
0410_175	Phoebe	 Well look, you dont really like the one from uptown and youre too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, youre done!
0410_176	Ross	 Yknow, youre right. Thank you.
0410_177	Phoebe	 Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.

0410_182	Chandler	 I did! I absolutely did!
0410_183	Rachel	 You idiot!!
0410_184	Chandler	 Im sure youre right, but why?
0410_185	Rachel	 You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
0410_186	Chandler	 Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry.

0515_071	Guy	 Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
0515_072	Ross	 Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
0515_073	Steve	 Oh hi Phoebe.
0515_074	Phoebe	 Mr. President.
0515_075	Steve	 I came to talk to you about Howard.
0515_076	Ross	 Howard?
0515_077	Steve	 Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
0515_078	Ross	 Oh that's nice.
0515_079	Steve	 Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
0515_080	Ross	 Oh. Uhh
0515_081	Steve	 Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)
0515_082	Ross	 No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in.
0515_083	Steve	 Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
0515_084	Ross	 Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
0515_085	Steve	 Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)
0515_086	Ross	 No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
0515_087	Steve	 Howard's the handy man!
0515_088	Ross	 Yes but too me he's just, man.
0515_089	Steve	 Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)
0515_090	Ross	 (To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
0515_091	Phoebe	 Yeah. I really like his glasses.
0515_092	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Ross is lamenting to Chandler and Rachel about his troubles in his new building.
0515_093	Ross	 so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
0515_094	Chandler	 (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
0515_095	Rachel	 Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
0515_096	Ross	 It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
0515_097	Rachel	 Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
0515_098	Ross	 Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
0515_099	Rachel	 And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
0515_100	Chandler	 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
0515_101	Rachel	 Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
0515_102	Chandler	 Wh-wh-why?!
0515_103	Rachel	 Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
0515_104	Chandler	 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
0515_105	Rachel	 Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
0515_106	Chandler	 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! Im right. I'm right. Am I right?
0515_107	Rachel	 No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
0515_108	Chandler	 Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
0515_109	Rachel	 Not unless different means the same.
0515_110	<scene>	Central Perk, Joey is sitting on the couch with Katie.
0515_111	Katie	 You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
0515_112	Joey	 (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
0515_113	Katie	 No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
0515_114	Joey	 Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
0515_115	Katie	 Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)
0515_116	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Monica are curled up on one of the chairs.
0515_117	Monica	 Isn't this great?
0515_118	Chandler	 Hmm.
0515_119	Monica	 Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
0515_120	Chandler	 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
0515_121	Monica	 Are you okay?
0515_122	Chandler	 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
0515_123	Monica	 What-what are you doing?
0515_124	Chandler	 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
0515_125	Monica	 Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
0515_126	Chandler	 What?!
0515_127	Monica	 Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
0515_128	Chandler	 Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
0515_129	Monica	 Oh and you know what I want!
0515_130	Chandler	 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
0515_131	Monica	 I do not have baby fever!
0515_132	Chandler	 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
0515_133	Monica	 Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
0515_134	Chandler	 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
0515_135	Monica	 You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
0515_136	Chandler	 Well, I did not know that.
0515_138	<scene>	Central Perk, Chandler is getting advice from Ross and Joey.
0515_139	Chandler	 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
0515_140	Ross And Joey	 Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
0515_141	Chandler	 By me?
0515_142	Ross	 Oh, no!
0515_143	Joey	 No-no.
0515_144	Ross	 Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
0515_145	Joey	 Yeah, big!
0515_146	<event>	Monica enters.
0515_147	Joey	 Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
0515_148	Monica	 Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
0515_149	Chandler	 Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
0515_150	Monica	 I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
0515_151	Chandler	 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
0515_152	Monica	 What?!
0515_153	Chandler	 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
0515_154	Monica	 Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
0515_155	<event>	Chandler turns to watch her go and then sees Ross and Joey both with huge grimaces on their faces.
0515_156	<scene>	Ross's apartment, he's having his party, only he's the only guest. He gets up and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it. So he takes it off and puts on one that says Dr. Geller and he puts the Ross one underneath the Dr. Geller one. Then as he turns off the music, we hear the party for Howard raging in the apartment across the hall.
0515_157	Party Guests	 (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigate the noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (He sees Phoebe chanting along with them.) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
0515_158	Ross	 Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
0515_159	Phoebe	 Oh, hi Ross!
0515_160	Ross	 What are you doing?
0515_161	Phoebe	 Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)
0515_162	Guest #1	 See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
0515_163	Ross	 You chipped in?!
0515_164	Phoebe	 Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
0515_165	Ross	 Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
0515_166	Phoebe	 Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
0515_167	Ross	 Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
0515_168	Phoebe	 No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
0515_169	Steve	 (walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!
0515_170	Phoebe	 Hey!
0515_171	Steve	 Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks away.)
0515_172	<event>	Ross turns and glares at Phoebe.
0515_173	Phoebe	 Yeah, okay, my bad.
0515_174	<scene>	Central Perk, Rachel is getting some coffee as Joey enters. He's looking a little puffy, but that's probably from the large number of different color sweaters he's wearing.
0515_175	Joey	 Hey!
0515_176	Rachel	 Hi! Wow! You look, you lookbig.
0515_177	Joey	 Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
0515_178	Rachel	 Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
0515_179	Joey	 Well look, Im breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
0515_180	Katie	 (entering) Hi!
0515_181	Joey	 Hey! Hiya!
0515_182	Rachel	 Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
0515_183	Katie	 Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
0515_184	Rachel	 Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
0515_185	Katie	 Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too much! (Punches Rachel.)
0515_186	Rachel	 Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
0515_187	Katie	 Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)
0515_188	Rachel	 Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
0515_189	Katie	 You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)
0515_190	Rachel	 Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
0515_191	Katie	 Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
0515_192	Joey	 Huh.
0515_193	Katie	 Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
0515_194	Joey	 Uhh.
0515_195	Katie	 You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
0515_196	Joey	 Nah.
0515_197	<event>	She looks at Rachel and storms out. After she's left Joey hugs Rachel in thanks.
0515_198	<scene>	Howard's party, Phoebe is talking Ross up to two more partygoers. Ross isn't happy about it.
0515_199	Ross	 (trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
0515_200	Phoebe	 (ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.)
0515_201	Ross	 (tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
0515_202	Phoebe	 Ooh. (Turns to him.)
0515_203	Ross	 Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
0515_204	Phoebe	 No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
0515_205	<event>	They go to the food table.
0515_206	Ross	 So uh, what did you tell them about me?
0515_207	Phoebe	 Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
0515_208	Ross	 Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
0515_209	Phoebe	 But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
0515_210	Ross	 What?!
0515_211	Phoebe	 Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
0515_212	Ross	 (trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
0515_213	Phoebe	 Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
0515_214	<error>	Guest #2: (sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?
0515_215	<event>	Steve goes over to look at Ross who's trying to look cool, but has some frosting on his lip.
0515_216	Steve	 3-B!
0515_217	All	 Oh yeah, aww!
0515_218	Steve	 Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
0515_219	<error>	Guest #3: Yeah, leave!
0515_220	All	 Yeah, get out! Now!
0515_221	Steve	 Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
0515_222	Phoebe	 All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
0515_223	<scene>	Ross's apartment, Ross and Phoebe have been banished to Ross's place.
0515_224	Phoebe	 Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
0515_225	Ross	 Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
0515_226	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Chandler comes running in. Everyone else is already there.
0515_227	Chandler	 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
0515_228	Monica	 (raising her hand) I'm Monica.
0515_229	Chandler	 I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
0515_230	Monica	 Okay.
0515_231	Chandler	 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
0515_232	Monica	 Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
0515_233	Chandler	 (getting out a ring box) Monica
0515_234	Monica	 No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
0515_235	Chandler	 Will you marry me?
0515_236	<event>	Phoebe hides her eyes in shame. Rachel is starring at them wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Joey and Ross are stunned to temporary silence.
0515_237	Ross	 Oh-no. No. No.
0515_238	Joey	 What a bad idea!
0515_239	Rachel	 Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
0515_240	Monica	 Chandler, why are you doing this?
0515_241	Chandler	 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
0515_242	Monica	 Chandler.
0515_243	Chandler	 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
0515_244	Monica	 Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
0515_245	Chandler	 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
0515_246	Monica	 (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
0515_247	Chandler	 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
0515_248	Monica	 Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
0515_249	Chandler	 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
0515_250	Monica	 Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
0515_251	Ross	 Hey!
0515_252	Joey	 She's right y'know.
0515_253	Ross	 Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
0515_254	Monica	 Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
0515_255	Chandler	 I didn't think I was!
0515_256	<event>	They hug.
0515_257	Monica	 Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
0515_258	Chandler	 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
0515_260	<scene>	Central Perk, Everyone is there.
0515_261	Joey	 Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
0515_262	Ross	 No, I will not!
0515_263	Joey	 Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
0515_264	Ross	 You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
0515_265	<event>	They all laugh.
0515_266	Phoebe	 Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
0515_267	Rachel	 Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
0515_268	Chandler	 Okay, how long is this going to go on.
0515_269	Monica	 Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
0515_270	Ross	 This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
0515_271	Chandler	 That's not funny.
0515_272	Joey	 That's not funny at all!
0515_273	<event>	They all get up and leave.
0519_001	<scene>	Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is getting ready for a date with Monica as Ross enters.
0519_002	Ross	 Hey!
0519_003	Chandler	 Hey!
0519_004	Ross	 Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
0519_005	Chandler	 Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
0519_006	Ross	 Wow! How'd you get in there?
0519_007	Chandler	 Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
0519_008	<event>	There's a knock on the door and Chandler answers it. It's the pizza delivery girl.
0519_009	Delivery Girl	 Hi Chandler!
0519_010	Chandler	 Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
0519_011	Caitlin	 Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
0519_012	Chandler	 Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
0519_013	Caitlin	 It's uh, 27 dollars even.
0519_014	Chandler	 Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
0519_015	<event>	The duck starts quacking.
0519_016	Caitlin	 Hey, where's the chicken?
0519_017	Chandler	 Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
0519_018	Caitlin	 (laughs) Great. I'll see you later!
0519_019	Chandler	 Okay, bye!
0519_020	<event>	He closes the door and turns to see Ross glaring at him.
0519_021	Ross	 What the hell was that?!
0519_022	Chandler	 What?
0519_023	Ross	 The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
0519_024	Chandler	 I was not flirting.
0519_025	Ross	 It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
0519_026	Chandler	 Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
0519_027	Ross	 Yeah, right.
0519_028	Chandler	 You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
0519_029	Ross	 (backing away) I'm good.
0519_031	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are in the kitchen.
0519_032	Rachel	 I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order !
0519_033	Phoebe	 I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
0519_034	Rachel	 No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
0519_035	Phoebe	 Don't get me started on that.
0519_036	<event>	Ross and Chandler enter with the pizzas.
0519_037	Chandler	 I was not flirting.
0519_038	Ross	 And on your anniversary, for shame!
0519_039	Rachel	 What's going on?
0519_040	Ross	 Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
0519_041	Chandler	 I was not and oh God, shh!
0519_042	Ross	 Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
0519_043	Phoebe	 Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
0519_044	Ross	 Well
0519_045	Chandler	 Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
0519_046	<event>	Ross looks at Rachel.
0519_047	Rachel	 Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
0519_048	Ross	 Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
0519_049	Rachel	 Hm-mmm.
0519_050	Ross	 And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
0519_051	Rachel	 Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
0519_052	Phoebe	 (looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
0519_053	Ross	 This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
0519_054	Phoebe	 See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
0519_055	Joey	 (entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
0519_056	Rachel	 Big night!
0519_057	Phoebe	 This is so cool!
0519_058	Chandler	 So, Joey on Law & Order , you must be very proud!
0519_059	Joey	 Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
0519_060	Chandler	 I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
0519_061	Joey	 She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
0519_062	<event>	They both start speaking Italian to each other, and since I'm not Italian and don't understand one word, we'll move on to the English portion of the show. Not, that I'm English. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I'm not. Y'know I think I should shut-up now and move on. Anyhoo, she says something about Joey being fat I think based on this line.
0519_063	Joey	 Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
0519_064	Monica	 (entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
0519_065	Chandler	 Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
0519_066	Monica	 So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London
0519_067	Chandler	 Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
0519_068	Monica	 Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
0519_069	Chandler	 The one that doesn't.
0519_070	Monica	 That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
0519_071	Chandler	 Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
0519_072	Monica	 That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
0519_073	Chandler	 Okay.
0519_074	Monica	 (runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
0519_075	Phoebe	 But I like it here!
0519_076	Monica	 You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
0519_077	Phoebe	 Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
0519_078	Monica	 Great!
0519_079	Phoebe	 Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
0519_080	Rachel	 Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)
0519_081	<event>	Phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. She speaks Italian to Joey's grandmother. She is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in English. Of course, too most people English is a strange language as well. But none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. So why am I talking about them? I have absolutely no clue. Moving on
0519_082	Joey	 Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
0519_083	Phoebe	 I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
0519_084	Rachel	 (She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
0519_085	Phoebe	 Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
0519_086	Rachel	 Oh what, you-you want both of them?
0519_087	Phoebe	 Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
0519_088	Rachel	 Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
0519_089	Phoebe	 Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
0519_090	Rachel	 Tell her to wear her own earrings.
0519_091	Phoebe	 These are her earrings.
0519_092	Rachel	 Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
0519_093	Phoebe	 Why not?
0519_094	Rachel	 Because I lose her stuff!
0519_095	<scene>	Time Lapse, the gang is now watching Law & Order . By the way, the entire rest of the episode takes place in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? Something to think about.
0519_096	Joey	 Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
0519_097	<event>	His grandmother asks him something.
0519_098	Joey	 Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
0519_099	Chandler	 If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
0519_100	Monica	 (noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
0519_101	Rachel	 Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
0519_102	Monica	 It's a diaper commercial.
0519_103	Rachel	 Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
0519_104	<event>	There's a knock on the door.
0519_105	Caitlin	 Pizza delivery!
0519_106	Ross	 I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
0519_107	Caitlin	 Hi!
0519_108	Ross	 Hi!
0519_109	Caitlin	 One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
0519_110	Ross	 Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
0519_111	Caitlin	 What?!
0519_112	Ross	 (I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
0519_113	Caitlin	 Oh. Thanks.
0519_114	Ross	 You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
0519_115	Caitlin	 Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
0519_116	Chandler	 Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
0519_117	Caitlin	 I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
0519_118	Chandler	 You're welcome.
0519_119	Ross	 You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
0519_120	Chandler	 What?
0519_121	Ross	 This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
0519_122	Monica	 What's goin' on?
0519_123	Ross	 Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
0519_124	Chandler	 Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
0519_125	Monica	 It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
0519_126	Ross	 Really?!
0519_127	Chandler	 Really?!
0519_128	Monica	 It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
0519_129	Chandler	 (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
0519_130	Monica	 Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
0519_131	Chandler	 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
0519_132	Joey	 (walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
0519_133	Monica	 Chandler, this actually bothers you?
0519_134	Chandler	 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
0519_135	Rachel	 Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
0519_136	Ross	 And thank you, for that.
0519_137	Rachel	 But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
0519_138	Ross	 What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
0519_139	Rachel	 Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
0519_140	Ross	 All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
0519_141	Phoebe	 (entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
0519_142	Rachel	 Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
0519_143	Phoebe	 On your dresser.
0519_144	Rachel	 Okay that is the one we already have!
0519_145	Joey	 Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
0519_146	Monica	 What?
0519_147	Joey	 (smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
0519_148	Chandler	 (smiling) Well, what is it?
0519_149	Joey	 (smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
0519_150	Rachel	 (smiling) What?!
0519_151	Ross	 (smiling) Are you sure?
0519_152	Phoebe	 (smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
0519_153	Joey	 (smiling) Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
0519_154	Rachel	 (smiling) Yeah.
0519_155	Joey	 (smiling) I'm in it.
0519_157	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.
0519_158	Phoebe	 (smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?
0519_159	Joey	 (smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
0519_160	Phoebe	 (not smiling) That's not good.
0519_161	Joey	 (smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)
0519_162	Rachel	 (smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
0519_163	Chandler	 (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
0519_164	Grandma Tribbiani	 (Something in Italian to Joey.)
0519_165	Joey	 Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)
0519_166	Grandma Tribbiani	 (pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!
0519_167	Joey	 No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
0519_168	Grandma Tribbiani	 No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors , Capricorn One .
0519_169	Chandler	 Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One .
0519_170	<event>	Phoebe gets up.
0519_171	Monica	 (following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
0519_172	Phoebe	 But I already gave them back to you!
0519_173	Monica	 No you didn't.
0519_174	Phoebe	 All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
0519_175	Rachel	 It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
0519_176	Phoebe	 Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
0519_177	Rachel	 Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
0519_178	Phoebe	 Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
0519_179	<event>	Rachel heads for Joey and Chandler's and Phoebe heads for the kitchen to find Ross.
0519_180	Ross	 (To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
0519_181	Phoebe	 (she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
0519_182	Ross	 Do you like it?
0519_183	Phoebe	 No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
0519_184	Ross	 Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
0519_185	Phoebe	 Ohh! I did not get that.
0519_186	<scene>	Cut to Chandler and Monica on the couch.
0519_187	Chandler	 So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order ?
0519_188	Monica	 Yeah, it's good.
0519_189	Chandler	 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
0519_190	Monica	 Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
0519_191	Chandler	 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
0519_192	Monica	 Go on, teach me something about men and women.
0519_193	Chandler	 Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
0519_194	Monica	 No way!
0519_195	Chandler	 It's true.
0519_196	Monica	 Well that's pathetic!
0519_197	Chandler	 Again true.
0519_198	Monica	 And this goes for all guys?
0519_199	Chandler	 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
0519_200	Joey	 (To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
0519_201	Ross	 Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!
0519_202	Joey	 I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
0519_203	Monica	 No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
0519_204	Joey	 (dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
0519_205	Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey!
0519_206	Chandler	 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
0519_207	<scene>	Time lapse, Rachel is coming back from Chandler and Joey's.
0519_208	Rachel	 (entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
0519_209	Phoebe	 Did you find it?
0519_210	Rachel	 The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
0519_211	Phoebe	 Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
0519_212	Rachel	 Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
0519_213	Monica	 (entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
0519_214	Phoebe	 (To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
0519_215	Rachel	 I don't know, I don't know.
0519_216	Phoebe	 All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
0519_217	Rachel	 Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
0519_218	Phoebe	 I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
0519_219	Rachel	 Ohh that'd be great!
0519_220	Phoebe	 Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
0519_221	Monica	 Yeah, what is it?
0519_222	Phoebe	 Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
0519_223	Monica	 (shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
0519_224	Phoebe	 I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
0519_225	Monica	 All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
0519_226	Phoebe	 No.
0519_227	Monica	 Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
0519_228	Phoebe	 Yeah! You're the best!
0519_229	Rachel	 Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
0519_230	Monica	 (angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
0519_231	Rachel	 Your sunglasses?!
0519_232	Monica	 Yes!
0519_233	Phoebe	 Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
0519_234	Caitlin	 (from outside) Pizza!
0519_235	Ross	 (running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
0519_236	Chandler	 Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
0519_237	Rachel	 Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
0519_238	Ross	 You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?
0519_239	All	 Caitlin!
0519_240	Grandma Tribbiani	 Caitlin!
0519_241	Ross	 (He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
0519_242	Caitlin	 It's uh, $12.50.
0519_243	Ross	 Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
0519_244	Caitlin	 No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
0519_245	Ross	 Gas? Wow! Intense.
0519_246	Chandler	 (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
0519_247	Ross	 (to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
0519_248	Caitlin	 (wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible, horrible place) Yeah.
0519_249	Ross	 They put that in.
0519_250	Caitlin	 What?!
0519_251	Ross	 The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
0519_252	Caitlin	 (getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!
0519_253	Ross	 A lot of other gas smells
0519_254	Chandler	 Oh the humanity.
0519_255	Ross	 Meth-methane smells
0519_256	Caitlin	 Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
0519_257	Ross	 Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
0519_258	Caitlin	 Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! (Runs for her life.)
0519_259	<event>	Ross closes the door slowly.
0519_260	Ross	 (To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
0519_261	Chandler	 More so than anything else.
0519_262	Phoebe	 I-I-I found it interesting.
0519_263	Rachel	 I'm sorry.
0519_264	Ross	 Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
0519_265	Rachel	 Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
0519_266	Phoebe	 (walking over to Ross) Ross?
0519_267	Ross	 Yeah?
0519_268	Phoebe	 What else do they add smell too?
0519_269	<scene>	The street outside the building, Rachel is running to catch up with Caitlin.
0519_270	Rachel	 Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
0519_271	Caitlin	 Oh, is there a problem?
0519_272	Rachel	 No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
0519_273	Caitlin	 Oh my God! That was flirting?!
0519_274	Rachel	 Yeah.
0519_275	Caitlin	 Wow!
0519_276	Rachel	 I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
0519_277	Caitlin	 The guy with the gas?!
0519_278	Rachel	 Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
0519_279	Caitlin	 Really?!
0519_280	Rachel	 Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
0519_281	Caitlin	 I just, I thought Joey was there.
0519_282	<scene>	Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey's grandmother are still watching Law & Order .
0519_283	Rachel	 (entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
0519_284	Ross	 What do you mean?
0519_285	Rachel	 Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
0519_286	Ross	 And she just gave you this?
0519_287	Rachel	 Yeah!
0519_288	Ross	 Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
0519_289	Rachel	 I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
0519_290	Ross	 Well that I can believe.
0519_291	Rachel	 Yay!
0519_292	Joey	 (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
0519_293	Chandler	 Almost over man.
0519_294	Joey	 (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
0519_295	Chandler	 Why am I looking?
0519_296	Joey	 Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
0519_297	<event>	Joey has made a little home movie that's his big scene. He braces himself against the door to his apartment and while holding a plastic gun and wearing the same sweater says
0519_298	Joey	 (on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
0519_299	Grandma Tribbiani	 Oh Joey!
0519_300	Joey	 That's right!
0519_301	Chandler	 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
0519_302	Joey	 (on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!
0519_303	Phoebe	 Oh no!
0519_304	Joey	 (on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
0519_305	Ross	 (To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
0519_306	Grandma Tribbiani	 Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
0519_307	<event>	Suddenly, the tape cuts away from Joey's impromptu scene, to Chandler standing really, really close to the camera.
0519_308	Chandler	 (singing) Ground control to Major Tom ! Commencing countdownengineson !

0622_254	Elizabeth	 Okay. I didnt know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)
0622_255	Paul	 Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or Ill have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
0622_256	Ross	 Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
0622_257	Paul	 No, let me explain! Fired!!

0622_263	Monica	 (going over to him) Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
0622_264	Chandler	 Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
0622_265	Monica	 Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?

0622_268	Chandler	 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
0622_269	Monica	 It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
0622_270	Chandler	 Okay.

0624_120	First Dorm Guy	 You put your balloons down!!
0624_121	<event>	Both opposing camps start screaming at each other to drop their weapons and surrender. Finally, Ross steps in as a mediator.

0624_134	Mr. Thompson	 And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentlemans day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey suddenly gets excited.)
0624_135	Joey	 I won! That was my guess!
0624_136	Rachel	 What?! What?! What?!
0624_137	Joey	 I guessed 20,000!

0624_145	Monica	 What are you doing?
0624_146	Chandler	 (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (Its a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)

0624_151	Monica	 (laughs) Are you sure youre okay?
0624_152	Chandler	 Yes! Im fine. In fact Ive been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.

0624_155	<event>	As hes talking Monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant. Lets see; I seem to remember him driving a Ferrari in Hawaii solving crimes as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.
0624_156	Monica	 (interrupting him) Oh my God!
0624_157	Chandler	 (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.

0624_159	Chandler	 What?! Im Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, thats Richard!
0624_160	Monica	 Oh God, maybe he wont see us. Richard!
0624_161	<event>	Monica smiles then acts shocked. Chandler cant believe she just did that.
0624_162	Richard	 (approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
0624_163	Chandler	 Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I dont know why I did that!

0624_172	Chandler	 Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.
0624_173	Monica	 Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?
0624_174	Chandler	 Yeah, Ill sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)

0624_179	Matire'D	 (motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandlers) Or if you prefer, this table is available.
0624_180	Richard	 That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)

0624_183	Rachel	 What were you thinking?!
0624_184	Joey	 I didnt know it was an auction!
0624_185	Rachel	 Wh?!
0624_186	Joey	 I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
0624_187	Rachel	 Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
0624_188	Joey	 I dont know! Charity?
0624_189	Rachel	 Ugh!
0624_190	Phoebe	 Well, just buy the damn boat! (Shes still working her way through her tray of booze.)
0624_191	Rachel	 Phoebe, dont you think youve had enough to drink?
0624_192	Phoebe	 Im just helping the kids!
0624_193	Rachel	 How is you drinking helping the kids?
0624_194	Phoebe	 Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
0624_195	Mr. Thompson	 (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
0624_196	Joey	 Oh hi!
0624_197	Mr. Thompson	 Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
0624_198	Joey	 Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
0624_199	Mr. Thompson	 I think it was valued at 19,000
0624_200	Joey	 (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I cant buy the boat, I dont have any money.
0624_201	<event>	Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.
0624_202	Rachel	 Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
0624_203	Mr. Thompson	 Thats good. Very good! (Walks away.)
0624_204	<event>	After hes left, Rachel stops laughing and glares at Joey again.
0624_205	Joey	 So uh listen, I think Im gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
0624_206	Rachel	 (stopping him) Hey! Youcantleave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
0624_207	Joey	 Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I dont have that kind of money!
0624_208	Rachel	 I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what were gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youre just gonna pay the difference.
0624_209	Joey	 Okay.
0624_210	Rachel	 Okay.
0624_211	Joey	 Look, I dont know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Yknow? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
0624_212	Rachel	 Not great.
0624_213	<scene>	The Restaurant, Monica and Chandlers and Richard and Lisas tables have been pushed together and theyre all eating and talking.
0624_214	Monica	 And so, were hiding in the bathroom.
0624_215	Richard	 And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
0624_216	Monica	 So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyre going at it right on the bathroom floor.
0624_217	Lisa	 (laughing) Oh my God!
0624_218	<error>	{Transcribers Note: For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out .}
0624_219	Chandler	 I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
0624_220	<event>	An awkward silence ensues.
0624_221	Richard	 Its so great seeing you guys again. Id like to make a toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
0624_222	Monica	 Ohh.
0624_223	Chandler	 What?!

0624_226	Ross	 Oh my God, you guys!! (Hes excited about what he thought happened.)
0624_227	Chandler	 (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
0624_228	Ross	 Who?
0624_229	Chandler	 Richard!
0624_230	Ross	 What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too.
0624_231	Chandler	 Oh you knew that. Good!
0624_232	Monica	 I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
0624_233	Ross	 Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
0624_234	Monica	 Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just cant get out of!
0624_235	Ross	 Yknow, maybe she is too young for me. Yknow, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I dont know what to do.
0624_236	Monica	 Why dont you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean thats what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.

0624_303	Phoebe	 Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
0624_304	Chandler	 Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
0624_305	Phoebe	 Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! Convince her that youre a little coward!
0624_306	Chandler	 I can do that, Ive had 30 years of practice.
0624_307	Joey	 Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)

0624_327	Chandler	 Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
0624_328	Joey	 (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
0624_329	Monica	 Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
0624_330	Chandler	 Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
0624_331	Monica	 Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!

0624_353	Richard	 Well yeah, Im sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.

0624_355	Richard	 I know this is crazy but am I too late?
0624_356	Monica	 What the Yes youre too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
0624_357	Richard	 Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Yknow after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!

0624_360	Monica	 Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I Im sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
0624_361	Richard	 Okay thats fine, Ill walk away. And Ill never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandlers willing to give you everything I am.
0624_362	Monica	 Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, Im the one thats making him wait!
0624_363	Richard	 You are?

0624_382	Rachel	 (staring at him) Whno, but yknow who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
0624_383	<scene>	A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.
0624_384	Monica	 So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?
0624_385	Chandler	 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!
0624_386	Monica	 Yeah, but thats pigs not people!
0624_387	Chandler	 If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
0624_388	Monica	 Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
0624_389	Chandler	 Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.
0624_390	Monica	 Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
0624_391	Chandler	 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?!
0624_392	Monica	 Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
0624_393	<event>	She gets up and storms out. The people at the other tables are staring at Chandler.
0624_394	Chandler	 (to them) Its okay, I got a plan.
0624_395	<scene>	Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.
0624_396	Rachel	 Were gonna find love!
0624_397	Phoebe	 Definitely!
0624_398	Rachel	 Yeah, Im pretty confident about that. Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
0624_399	Phoebe	 What do you mean?
0624_400	Rachel	 Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
0624_401	Phoebe	 You mean a backup?
0624_402	Rachel	 Exactly!
0624_403	Phoebe	 Yeah, yeah I got that.
0624_404	Rachel	 You do?
0624_405	Phoebe	 Hm-mmm.
0624_406	Rachel	 Who?
0624_407	Phoebe	 Joey.
0624_408	Rachel	 Joey?!
0624_409	Phoebe	 Yeah!
0624_410	Rachel	 Are you serious?!
0624_411	Phoebe	 Yeah, I locked him years ago!
0624_412	Rachel	 Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
0624_413	Phoebe	 Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
0624_414	Rachel	 Oh, seriously?
0624_415	Phoebe	 Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
0624_416	Rachel	 Charming.
0624_417	Phoebe	 Well hey, its just a backup.
0624_418	Rachel	 Yeah.
0624_419	<scene>	Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his slipknots as Monica enters.
0624_420	Joey	 Hey Monica!
0624_421	Monica	 Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
0624_422	Joey	 This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
0624_423	Monica	 Yeah, its great.
0624_424	Joey	 Whoa-whoa, whats the matter?! Talk to the captain!
0624_425	Monica	 Im just having one of those days where you realize youre in a dead-end relationship!
0624_426	Joey	 Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
0624_427	Monica	 Its not like I want to get married tomorrow! Its just that I-Id like to believe that Im in a relationship thats actually going somewhere, that Im not just wasting my time!
0624_428	Joey	 Well, you know Chandler.
0624_429	Monica	 No I dont know Chandler! Not anymore! Its like its like somethings changed.
0624_430	Joey	 Maybe you changed?
0624_431	Monica	 I didnt change!
0624_432	Joey	 Maybe thats the problem.
0624_433	Monica	 What?!
0624_434	Joey	 Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
0624_435	Monica	 Is that some kind of boat talk?
0624_436	Joey	 I dont know! (All excited) I havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
0624_437	Monica	 What does he think? Does he think Im just gonna wait around for nothing?
0624_438	Joey	 Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
0624_439	Monica	 (starts for the door) Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
0624_440	Joey	 There are?
0624_441	Monica	 Yeah! Richard!
0624_442	Joey	 R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!
0624_443	Monica	 Thats right.
0624_444	Joey	 Chandler loves marriage!!
0624_445	Monica	 You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife! That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
0624_446	Joey	 You got that from what I said?!

0624_456	Rachel	 Yeah, love. Its a tricky business isnt it?
0624_457	Ross	 I guess so.
0624_458	Rachel	 So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time were 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weve-weve already slept together so yknow therell be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "Whats that?!"
0624_459	Ross	 Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
0624_460	Rachel	 Exactly.

0624_581	Richard	 Well, apparently Im willing to offer her things that you are not.
0624_582	Chandler	 But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, shed be surprised!
0624_583	Richard	 Well if it helps, it worked very well.
0624_584	Chandler	 It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.
0624_585	Richard	 You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)

0624_587	Richard	 No I dont have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, dont let her go. Trust me.

0624_599	Chandler	 Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?!
0624_600	Joey	 I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe me.
0624_601	Chandler	 Well where Where did she go?
0624_602	Joey	 To her parents I think and she said you shouldnt call her. But if I were you I would.

(Starting to cry again.) And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?

0721_155	Chandler	 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
0721_156	Monica	 Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
0721_157	<event>	Joey thinks it over.
0721_158	Joey	 All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
0721_159	<scene>	Cut to Rachel listening to a phone conversation between Chandler and Monica in The One With All the Resolutions.
0721_160	Monica	 (on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
0721_161	Chandler	 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
0721_162	Monica	 (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
0721_163	Rachel	 Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)

0721_175	Phoebe	 YOU KNOW?!!!
0721_176	Rachel	 Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
0721_177	Ross	 (entering) What's going on?
0721_178	Phoebe And Rachel	 Ohhh!!!
0721_179	Rachel	 (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!
0721_180	Ross	 What?! What?!
0721_181	Rachel	 Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
0721_182	Ross	 Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
0721_183	Phoebe	 (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)

0721_186	Phoebe	 Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
0721_187	Joey	 Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
0721_188	Phoebe	 Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
0721_189	<scene>	Cut to later in that episode. Rachel and Phoebe are going to a movie from Monica and Chandlers, and as Phoebe walks by Chandler she pinches him on the butt and exits.
0721_190	Rachel	 All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
0721_191	Monica	 Bye!
0721_192	All	 Bye!
0721_193	Phoebe	 Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
0721_194	Chandler	 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
0721_195	Monica	 Actually, I did!
0721_196	Chandler	 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
0721_197	Monica	 Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
0721_198	<scene>	Cut to later in that episode. Monica and Chandler are confronting Joey in his apartment about Phoebes knowledge.

0721_202	Joey	 Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
0721_203	Monica	 Joey!
0721_204	Joey	 And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
0721_205	Monica	 Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
0721_206	Chandler	 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
0721_207	<scene>	Cut to later in that episode. Phoebe is telling Rachel in Monica and Chandlers that Chandler wants to make a date with Phoebe.
0721_208	Phoebe	 I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
0721_209	Rachel	 Are you kidding?!
0721_210	Phoebe	 No!
0721_211	Rachel	 I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?
0721_212	Joey	 No.
0721_213	Rachel	 Joey!
0721_214	Joey	 They know you know.
0721_215	Rachel	 Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
0721_216	Phoebe	 God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!
0721_217	Joey	 I couldn't even if I wanted too.
0721_218	<scene>	Cut to later in that episode. Chandler is in his bathroom with Monica, and hes panicking on how far Phoebe is pushing him.
0721_219	Chandler	 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
0721_220	Monica	 She's bluffing!
0721_221	Chandler	 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
0721_222	<scene>	Cut to the hallway where Phoebe is conferring with Rachel.
0721_223	Phoebe	 He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
0721_224	Joey	 (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
0721_225	Rachel	 Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
0721_226	Joey	 Ooh!
0721_227	Rachel	 Okay!
0721_228	Joey	 I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
0721_229	Phoebe	 Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didnt rip off any buttons.
0721_230	Joey	 It's not my first time.
0721_231	<scene>	Cut to the bathroom.
0721_232	Monica	 You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
0721_233	Chandler	 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
0721_234	Monica	 Of course.
0721_235	<scene>	Cut back to the living room. Chandler slowly exits the bathroom and gets pushed from behind by Monica and sees Phoebe closing the apartment door.
0721_236	Chandler	 Oh, you're-you're going?
0721_237	Phoebe	 Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
0721_238	Chandler	 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
0721_239	Phoebe	 You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
0721_240	Chandler	 Not if I kiss you first.
0721_241	<event>	They move closer to together and Phoebe hesitantly puts her hand on Chandler's hip. He puts his hand on her left hip but then decides to put his hand on her left hip. Phoebe then grabs his butt. Chandler goes for her breast, but stops and puts his hand on her shoulder.
0721_242	Phoebe	 Ooh.
0721_243	Chandler	 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
0721_244	Phoebe	 Here it comes. Our first kiss.
0721_245	<event>	They slowly and hesitantly move their lips together and kiss gently. Phoebe has her eyes wide open in shock and Chandler is squinting. He finally breaks the kiss after only a short while and pushes Phoebe away.
0721_246	Chandler	 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
0721_247	Phoebe	 And why not?!
0721_248	Chandler	 Because I'm in love with Monica!!
0721_249	Phoebe	 You're-you're what?!
0721_250	<event>	Monica comes out of the bathroom like a bolt, and Rachel and Joey both enter.
0721_251	Chandler	 Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
0721_252	Monica	 I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
0721_253	Phoebe	 I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
0721_254	Joey	 So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
0721_255	Monica	 Well actually, Ross doesn't.
0721_256	Chandler	 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
0721_257	<scene>	Cut to later in that episode. Ross is showing his boss his new place and notices something in the window.
0721_258	Ross	 (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0721_260	Phoebe	 Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
0721_261	Rachel	 You really think it would be that different?
0721_262	Phoebe	 How could it not be? I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
0721_263	Rachel	 Well, things change.
0721_264	Joey	 I dont want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
0721_265	Ross	 Itll be okay Joe.
0721_266	Joey	 Im sorry, I justI like things the way they are.
0721_267	<scene>	Flashback to the gang in Central Perk in The One Where Nana Dies Twice, theyre all going through an old photo album.
0721_268	Rachel	 Hey, who's this little naked guy?
0721_269	Ross	 That little naked guy would be me.
0721_270	Rachel	 Aww, look at the little thing.
0721_271	Ross	 Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
0721_272	Chandler	 Who are those people?

0721_276	Monica	 Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?

0721_293	Rachel	 Okay.
0721_294	Phoebe	 Okay.
0721_295	<event>	They spilt into their sexes and the girls read Monicas and the guys read Chandlers. The girls gasp and groan and the guys laugh hysterically.
0721_296	Phoebe	 (To Monica) Oh, thats beautiful.
0721_297	Joey	 (To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! Thats good!
0721_298	Rachel	 (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
0721_299	<event>	Ross laughs.
0721_300	Joey	 What? I dont get it.
0721_301	<event>	Ross points to the explanation and he gets it.
0721_302	Ross	 (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.

0721_310	Chandler	 You really like it?
0721_311	Ross	 Dude! How-how did you write this?
0721_312	Chandler	 I stole Monicas and changed the name.
0721_313	Ross	 You cant do that!
0721_314	Joey	 If he goes first he can!
0921_001	<scene>	Central Perk
0921_002	Monica	 It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
0921_003	Ross	 Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE !
0921_004	Chandler	 I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
0921_005	Ross	 Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
0921_006	Rachel	 I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
0921_007	Ross	 Why do you care so much?
0921_008	Monica	 Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
0921_009	Rachel	 (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
0921_010	Ross	 Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
0921_011	Phoebe	 Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid !
0921_012	Rachel	 All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
0921_013	Ross	 Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
0921_014	<event>	Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her
0921_015	Ross	 Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
0921_016	Joey	 Hey!
0921_017	All	 Hi!
0921_018	Ross	 I'm gonna get some more coffee.
0921_019	Charlie	 Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
0921_020	Ross	 Ok. (they both go)
0921_021	Chandler	 (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
0921_022	Joey	 Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?
0921_023	Charlie	 (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
0921_024	Ross	 Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
0921_025	Charlie	 You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
0921_026	Ross	 Yeah, I know the type.
0921_027	Joey	 Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
0921_029	<scene>	Joey and Rachel's apartment
0921_030	Phoebe	 (entering) Hey!
0921_031	Monica	 Hey!
0921_032	Phoebe	 Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
0921_033	Rachel	 Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
0921_034	Phoebe	 I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
0921_035	Rachel	 (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
0921_036	Phoebe	 Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
0921_037	Monica	 Hey, what's this?
0921_038	Rachel	 Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
0921_039	Monica	 Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
0921_040	Rachel	 Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
0921_041	Monica	 Do you wanna go hunting?
0921_042	Rachel	 Well, I would like to have the option!!
0921_043	Phoebe	 (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
0921_044	Rachel	 Oh!
0921_045	Phoebe	 No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
0921_046	Monica	 And she wants to go hunting, too!!
0921_047	Rachel	 Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
0921_048	Phoebe	 Ok, this is not about the MONEY , ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
0921_049	Rachel	 I don't care about any of that!!
0921_050	Phoebe	 Well, do you care about friendship?
0921_051	Rachel	 Oh!
0921_052	Phoebe	 I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
0921_053	Rachel	 Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
0921_054	Phoebe	 Promise?
0921_055	Rachel	 I promise.
0921_056	Phoebe	 Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
0921_057	Rachel	 But I am going hunting!!
0921_058	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's apartment
0921_059	Monica	 (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
0921_060	Chandler	 Oh, yeah?
0921_061	Monica	 Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
0921_062	Chandler	 Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
0921_063	Monica	 Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
0921_064	Chandler	 We really need to take those tests?
0921_065	Monica	 Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
0921_066	Chandler	 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
0921_067	Monica	 What is the big deal?
0921_068	Chandler	 It's weird! In a doctor's office?
0921_069	Monica	 It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
0921_070	Chandler	 (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
0921_071	Monica	 Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
0921_072	Chandler	 Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
0921_073	Monica	 (really embarrassed) OH!
0921_074	Chandler	 Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
0921_075	<scene>	Joey's apartment

0921_084	Joey	 Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
0921_085	Charlie	 So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
0921_086	Joey	 Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
0921_087	Charlie	 Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun !
0921_088	Joey	 Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
0921_089	Charlie	 Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
0921_090	Joey	 (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
0921_091	Charlie	 And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
0921_092	Joey	 I know, yeah!
0921_093	Charlie	 And first, I have to see the MET!
0921_094	Joey	 Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
0921_095	Charlie	 No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
0921_096	Joey	 Which one, they all suck!
0921_097	Charlie	 The museum!
0921_098	Joey	 (looking puzzled) I don't think so.
0921_099	<scene>	SPA massage center, Rachel enters
0921_100	Rachel	 (to the receptionist) Hi there!

0921_112	Receptionist	 Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
0921_113	Phoebe	 Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
0921_114	Receptionist	 Sorry, everyone is booked!
0921_115	Phoebe	 But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
0921_116	Receptionist	 Then why you work here?
0921_117	Phoebe	 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
0921_118	Receptionist	 Well, I think this is a great place to work!
0921_119	Phoebe	 (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
0921_120	<scene>	Central Perk
0921_121	<event>	Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa
0921_122	Joey	 Ross!
0921_123	Ross	 Hi!
0921_124	Joey	 I need to talk to you about Charlie.
0921_125	Ross	 (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
0921_126	Joey	 Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
0921_127	Ross	 Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
0921_128	Joey	 No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
0921_129	Ross	 Get to the problem!
0921_130	Joey	 Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
0921_131	Ross	 (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
0921_132	Joey	 (checking) EH, what do you know!
0921_133	Ross	 You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
0921_134	Joey	 Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
0921_135	Ross	 You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
0921_136	Joey	 Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
0921_137	Ross	 (after a short hesitation) Fine.
0921_138	Joey	 Thanks.
0921_139	Ross	 Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
0921_140	Joey	 The Metsss!
0921_141	Ross	 Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
0921_142	Joey	 (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
0921_143	Ross	 Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
0921_144	Joey	 Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
0921_145	Ross	 Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
0921_146	Joey	 Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
0921_147	Ross	 But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
0921_148	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
0921_149	Ross	 Ok.
0921_150	Joey	 You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
0921_151	Ross	 Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
0921_152	Joey	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)
0921_153	<scene>	doctor's waiting room
0921_154	Chandler	 I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
0921_155	Monica	 Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
0921_156	<event>	a nurse walks in
0921_157	Nurse	 Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
0921_158	Chandler	 Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
0921_159	Monica	 Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
0921_160	Chandler	 Yeah, I guess!
0921_161	Monica	 I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
0921_162	Janice	 OH MY GOD!!
0921_163	Chandler	 Oh, Come on!
0921_165	Janice	 Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
0921_166	Monica	 Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
0921_167	Chandler	 Why are you here?
0921_168	Janice	 Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
0921_169	Chandler	 (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why ? why is she here??
0921_170	Janice	 Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand).
0921_171	Chandler	 What!?
0921_172	<event>	Janice does her "Janice Laugh"
0921_173	Monica	 This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
0921_174	Chandler	 I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
0921_175	Janice	 Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you need a hand!
0921_176	Chandler	 (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
0921_177	<scene>	At the Spa, Phoebe is at the half-opened door
0921_178	Phoebe	 (In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
0921_179	Rachel	 Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
0921_180	Phoebe	 Okay, then I'm Swedish...
0921_181	Monica	 So, what's your name?
0921_182	Phoebe	 It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
0921_183	Rachel	 Oh... what an interesting name.
0921_184	Phoebe	 Ja!
0921_185	Rachel	 You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)
0921_186	Phoebe	 (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
0921_187	Rachel	 (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
0921_188	Phoebe	 Is something wrong?
0921_189	Rachel	 No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
0921_190	Phoebe	 (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
0921_191	Rachel	 Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
0921_192	<scene>	Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum
0921_193	Joey	 (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
0921_194	Ross	 Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
0921_195	Joey	 (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
0921_196	Ross	 Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
0921_197	Joey	 Phonetically? (Looks confused)
0921_198	Ross	 Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
0921_199	Joey	 Ok.
0921_200	Ross	 Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
0921_201	Joey	 Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
0921_202	Ross	 Wow. What does that mean?
0921_203	Joey	 No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
0921_204	Ross	 Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
0921_205	Joey	 Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
0921_206	Ross	 Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
0921_207	Joey	 Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
0921_208	Ross	 No! (Slaps his hand)
0921_209	<scene>	The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms
0921_210	Chandler	 (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
0921_211	Janice	 Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
0921_212	Chandler	 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
0921_213	Janice	 That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
0921_214	Chandler	 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
0921_215	Janice	 Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
0921_216	Chandler	 (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
0921_217	Janice	 Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
0921_218	Chandler	 (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
0921_219	Janice	 What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
0921_220	Chandler	 (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!! "
0921_221	<scene>	Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging Rachel
0921_222	Phoebe	 (Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
0921_223	Rachel	 Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
0921_224	Phoebe	 Oh, Ja! Ja!
0921_225	Rachel	 Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
0921_226	Phoebe	 Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
0921_227	Rachel	 I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
0921_228	Phoebe	 Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
0921_229	Rachel	 (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
0921_230	Phoebe	 You know it's me?
0921_231	Rachel	 For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
0921_232	Phoebe	 How can you come here?
0921_233	Rachel	 How could you not tell me you worked here?
0921_234	Phoebe	 I don't have to tell you everything!
0921_235	Rachel	 Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
0921_236	Phoebe	 Tips not included.
0921_237	Rachel	 Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
0921_238	Phoebe	 Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
0921_239	Rachel	 Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
0921_240	Phoebe	 You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
0921_241	Rachel	 Good for you Pheebs!
0921_242	Phoebe	 Ok.
0921_243	Phoebe	 Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
0921_244	<scene>	Central Perk. Ross is playing some shoot'em up game on his laptop
0921_245	Ross	 Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die !
0921_246	<event>	Charlie walks in.
0921_247	Ross	 (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
0921_248	Charlie	 Hi!
0921_249	Ross	 Hey, how was the Met?
0921_250	Charlie	 The museum was amazing!
0921_251	Ross	 Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
0921_252	Charlie	 Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
0921_253	Ross	 What do you mean?
0921_254	Charlie	 Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
0921_255	Ross	 (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
0921_256	Charlie	 No, we went to the left.
0921_257	Ross	 (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
0921_258	Charlie	 Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).
0921_259	Ross	 What?
0921_260	Charlie	 Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
0921_261	Ross	 What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
0921_262	Charlie	 Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
0921_263	Ross	 (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
0921_264	Charlie	 Yeah, I guess that's true.
0921_265	Ross	 And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
0921_266	Charlie	 He is very sweet. Plus he's hot !
0921_267	Ross	 That was going to be my next argument.
0921_268	<event>	Joey walks in
0921_269	Joey	 Hey!
0921_270	Ross	 Hey!
0921_271	Charlie	 Hey!
0921_272	Joey	 (to Charlie) You're ready?
0921_273	Charlie	 Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks Ross.
0921_274	Joey	 (aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
0921_275	Ross	 Glad I could help man.
0921_276	Joey	 Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
0921_277	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper.
0921_278	Chandler	 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
0921_279	<event>	phone rings
0921_280	Chandler	 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
0921_281	<event>	Monica walks in
0921_282	Monica	 Hey sweetie.
0921_283	Chandler	 Doctor Connelly just called.
0921_284	Monica	 With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
0921_285	Chandler	 Actually it's both of us.
0921_286	Monica	 What?
0921_287	Chandler	 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
0921_288	Monica	 Oh... what does that mean?
0921_289	Chandler	 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
0921_290	Monica	 Chandler?
0921_291	Chandler	 (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
0921_292	Monica	 (weeping) Oh my God!
0921_293	Chandler	 I'm sorry.
0921_294	Monica	 I'm sorry too.
0921_295	<event>	they hug
0921_296	Chandler	 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
0921_297	Monica	 (still weeping) I know.
0921_299	<scene>	The Spa Reception. Phoebe walks in
0921_300	Receptionist	 Good morning Phoebe.
0921_301	Phoebe	 (imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
0921_302	Receptionist	 Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
0921_303	Phoebe	 Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?
0921_304	<event>	Phoebe walks to the door and half-opens it
0921_305	Phoebe	 (through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
0922_001	<scene>	Central Perk. Charlie, Joey and Rachel are on the couches
0922_002	Charlie	 (while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!
0922_003	Rachel	 (speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
0922_004	Charlie	 I'm sorry, what?
0922_005	Rachel	 Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
0922_006	Charlie	 From... Cosmo??
0922_007	Rachel	 Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
0922_008	Charlie	 (to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
0922_009	Joey	 So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
0922_010	Rachel	 (hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
0922_011	Joey	 Oh hey Rach!
0922_012	Rachel	 Yeah...
0922_013	Joey	 Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
0922_014	Rachel	 Oh, well...
0922_015	Charlie	 I'm sure you have better things to do.
0922_016	Joey	 Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
0922_017	Charlie	 If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
0922_018	Rachel	 Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
0922_019	Joey	 (to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
0922_020	Phoebe	 (entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?
0922_021	Joey	 What's the matter, Pheebs?
0922_022	Phoebe	 Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
0922_023	Rachel	 Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
0922_024	Phoebe	 Exactly!
0922_025	Rachel	 And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
0922_026	Phoebe	 (after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!
0922_027	Rachel	 Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
0922_028	Phoebe	 Ok, that'll be great!
0922_029	Joey	 Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
0922_030	Rachel	 That's not what we're gonna do!
0922_031	Joey	 Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
0922_033	<scene>	Doctor Connelly's office
0922_034	Chandler	 (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
0922_035	Monica	 Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
0922_036	Chandler	 Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
0922_037	Doctor Connelly	 (entering) Hi there.
0922_038	Chandler	 Hi.
0922_039	Monica	 Hi.
0922_040	Doctor Connelly	 I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
0922_041	Monica	 Ok.
0922_042	Doctor Connelly	 Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
0922_043	Chandler	 Oh, DAMN IT!
0922_044	<event>	Dr. Connelly glares at Chandler
0922_045	Monica	 Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
0922_046	Doctor Connelly	 Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
0922_047	Monica	 (long pause) Ok.
0922_048	Doctor Connelly	 And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
0922_049	Chandler	 Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
0922_050	<scene>	Central Perk. Joey and Charlie on the couch. Rachel enters
0922_051	Rachel	 Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
0922_052	Charlie	 Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
0922_053	Joey	 (to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
0922_054	Rachel	 Not gonna find any clothes in there!
0922_055	Ross	 (entering) Hey, you guys!
0922_056	Rachel	 Hi.
0922_057	Ross	 Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
0922_058	Charlie	 Umh... Kurts Baley?
0922_059	Ross	 Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
0922_060	Joey	 Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
0922_061	Charlie	 So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
0922_062	Ross	 Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
0922_063	Charlie	 He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
0922_064	Ross	 Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
0922_065	Rachel	 Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
0922_066	Ross	 Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
0922_067	Chandler	 (entering) Hey guys!
0922_068	Ross	 Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
0922_069	Chandler	 I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
0922_070	Ross	 It's in Barbados.
0922_071	Chandler	 But you come first!
0922_072	Rachel	 I'm there!
0922_073	Charlie	 We'll see you, guys! (she goes)
0922_074	Joey	 Bye.
0922_075	Rachel	 Bye, see ya. (she goes)
0922_076	Chandler	 (sitting down on the couch) Ok.
0922_077	Joey	 All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
0922_078	Chandler	 Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
0922_079	Ross	 So-so what did the doctor say?
0922_080	Chandler	 Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
0922_081	Joey	 So you're ruling out surrogacy?
0922_082	Chandler	 Yeah.
0922_083	Joey	 So, I don't have to learn what that means?
0922_084	Chandler	 Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
0922_085	Joey	 Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
0922_086	Chandler	 (stopping Joey) ah-ha!
0922_087	Ross	 How do you feel about all this?
0922_088	Chandler	 I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
0922_089	Joey	 Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
0922_090	Ross	 (puzzled) What?
0922_091	<event>	Joey moves close to Ross and whispers something in his ear
0922_092	Ross	 (looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
0922_093	<scene>	Professor Sherman's office, Ross is relating to Professor Sherman
0922_094	Ross	 The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
0922_095	Professor Sherman	 Mmm-mm.
0922_096	Ross	 (reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
0922_097	<event>	Turns to look at Professor Sherman, only to discover that he is sleeping
0922_098	Ross	 Oh, that's not what you want...
0922_099	<scene>	Shop, Rachel, Charlie and Phoebe walk in
0922_100	Shop Assistant	 (to a girl) Incentive For Men?
0922_101	Phoebe	 Oh, I'll take some of that.
0922_102	Rachel	 Pheebs, that's for men!
0922_103	Phoebe	 No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
0922_104	<event>	The shop assistant sprays the perfume on Phoebe's neck
0922_105	Phoebe	 Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
0922_106	Charlie	 (to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
0922_107	Rachel	 On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
0922_108	Charlie	 See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
0922_109	Rachel	 Really?
0922_110	Charlie	 Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
0922_111	Rachel	 Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
0922_112	Charlie	 You've seen all the movies...
0922_113	Rachel	 Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
0922_114	Phoebe	 (picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
0922_115	Rachel	 Sure!
0922_116	Phoebe	 Ok!
0922_117	Charlie	 Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
0922_118	Rachel	 You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
0922_119	<event>	Phoebe and Rachel go off to the dressing rooms. They enter one and close the curtain.
0922_120	Phoebe	 So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
0922_121	Rachel	 She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
0922_122	Phoebe	 Why?
0922_123	Rachel	 I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
0922_124	Phoebe	 Who else?
0922_125	Rachel	 Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
0922_126	Phoebe	 You like Joey?
0922_127	Rachel	 Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
0922_128	Phoebe	 (whispering) Oh my God!
0922_129	Rachel	 It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
0922_130	Phoebe	 Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
0922_131	Rachel	 (annoyed) Oh, I get it!
0922_132	Phoebe	 Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
0922_133	Rachel	 I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
0922_134	Phoebe	 Yeah.
0922_135	Rachel	 So can we keep this between us?
0922_136	Phoebe	 Sure!
0922_137	Rachel	 Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
0922_138	Phoebe	 Oh.
0922_139	<event>	Rachel opens the curtains and sees Charlie coming out from the dressing room just next to theirs
0922_140	Phoebe	 Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
0922_141	<scene>	Monica's apartment, Chandler walks in with a friend of his while Monica is putting fruit in a bowl.
0922_142	Monica	 Hi honey!
0922_143	Chandler	 Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
0922_144	Monica	 Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
0922_145	Zack	 (shaking Monica's hand) You too.
0922_146	Chandler	 You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
0922_147	Monica	 I got it.
0922_148	Zack	 Thanks.
0922_149	Chandler	 (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
0922_150	Monica	 Yeah, I guess.
0922_151	Chandler	 So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
0922_152	Monica	 (turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
0922_153	Chandler	 Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
0922_154	Monica	 Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
0922_155	Chandler	 No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
0922_156	Monica	 Chandler!
0922_157	Chandler	 I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
0922_158	Monica	 I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
0922_159	Chandler	 Ok!
0922_160	Monica	 Uh!
0922_161	Chandler	 (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
0922_162	Zack	 Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
0922_163	<event>	Monica hears that and is suddenly very interested in Zack
0922_164	Monica	 Tell me about yourself, Zack!
0922_165	<scene>	Shop, Phoebe and Rachel are talking in front of the dressing room
0922_166	Rachel	 Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
0922_167	Phoebe	 Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
0922_168	Rachel	 Ok, great!
0922_169	<event>	Phoebe moves in the dressing room from which Charlie went out
0922_170	Rachel	 Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
0922_171	Phoebe	 (sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
0922_172	Rachel	 (sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!
0922_173	Phoebe	 (goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
0922_174	Rachel	 (comes out again) What!?
0922_175	Phoebe	 (comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
0922_176	Rachel	 Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
0922_177	Phoebe	 Ooh! We have a problem.
0922_178	Rachel	 Oh! What are we gonna do?
0922_179	<event>	A strange woman sticks her head out from a third changing cubicle to the far right
0922_180	Stranger	 Just be honest with her.
0922_181	Rachel	 Oh my God!
0922_182	Stranger	 And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
0922_183	Rachel	 (yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
0922_184	<scene>	Joey's apartment. Joey is sitting on his bed and the phone rings
0922_185	Joey	 Hello?
0922_186	Ross	 Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
0922_187	Joey	 No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
0922_188	Ross	 I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
0922_189	Joey	 Oh! How's it going?
0922_190	Ross	 It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
0922_191	Joey	 What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
0922_192	Ross	 Barbados.
0922_193	Joey	 Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
0922_194	Ross	 What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
0922_195	Joey	 Well, just wake him up!
0922_196	Ross	 I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
0922_197	Joey	 Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
0922_198	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's apartement. Chandler and the guest are in the living room, Monica in the kitchen
0922_199	Monica	 Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
0922_200	Zack	 Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!
0922_201	Chandler	 So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
0922_202	Monica	 Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay !!
0922_203	Chandler	 You don't like him.
0922_204	Monica	 I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
0922_205	Chandler	 Alright! Just follow my lead!
0922_206	<event>	Zack comes out of the bathroom. They all sit down at the table.
0922_207	Zack	 You guys have such a great place here.
0922_208	Chandler	 Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
0922_209	Zack	 Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
0922_210	Chandler	 (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
0922_211	Zack	 (looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
0922_212	Monica	 Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
0922_213	Zack	 (after a pause, very confused) No...
0922_214	Monica	 Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
0922_215	Zack	 You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
0922_216	Monica	 We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
0922_217	Zack	 Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
0922_218	Chandler	 You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
0922_219	Zack	 Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
0922_220	<error>	Monica & Chandler: Sure! Alright...
0922_221	Zack	 Ravioli's delicious!
0922_222	Chandler	 I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
0922_223	Zack	 No I didn't.
0922_224	Monica	 Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
0922_225	Chandler	 (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
0922_226	<scene>	In the store. Rachel and Phoebe returning from the changing rooms
0922_227	Rachel	 Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
0922_228	Phoebe	 Good plan.
0922_229	Rachel	 Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
0922_230	Phoebe	 Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! (at which she walks away)
0922_231	Rachel	 (to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
0922_232	Charlie	 Oh! trying on clothes.
0922_233	Rachel	 (pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
0922_234	Charlie	 (smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
0922_235	Rachel	 Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
0922_236	Charlie	 No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
0922_237	Rachel	 (after a pause) Yeah.
0922_238	Charlie	 It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
0922_239	Rachel	 Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
0922_240	Charlie	 Wow!
0922_241	Rachel	 Yeah...
0922_242	Charlie	 You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
0922_243	Rachel	 (Looks ashamed) I try...

0922_246	Ross	 (To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
0922_247	Prof. Sherman	 (confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
0922_248	<scene>	Central Perk. Joey is sitting on the sofa, eating a cookie.
0922_249	<event>	Phoebe walks in wearing a fancy, revealing dress, and stands before Joey
0922_250	Joey	 (impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
0922_251	Phoebe	 Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
0922_252	Joey	 Then don't go!
0922_253	Phoebe	 Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
0922_254	Joey	 Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
0922_255	Phoebe	 You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
0922_256	<event>	Joey gives Phoebe a thumbs up. Phoebe walks out
0922_257	<scene>	Outside Central Perk.

0922_261	Phoebe	 Oh my God! (they hug)
0922_262	David	 Wow, you look unbelievable.
0922_263	Phoebe	 Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
0922_264	David	 Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
0922_265	Phoebe	 What happened?
0922_266	David	 Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
0922_267	Phoebe	 Yeah?
0922_268	David	 Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
0922_269	Phoebe	 Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
0922_270	David	 Good, good, life is good...
0922_271	Phoebe	 Good!
0922_272	David	 Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
0922_273	Phoebe	 (disappointed) Oh, good for you.
0922_274	David	 She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
0922_275	Phoebe	 Mike and I broke up.
0922_276	David	 You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
0922_277	Phoebe	 Really?
0922_278	David	 Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
0922_279	Phoebe	 I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
0922_280	David	 Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
0922_281	Phoebe	 Well... (pause) no.
0922_282	David	 Do you wanna get a drink?
0922_283	Phoebe	 I'd love to.
0922_284	David	 Great.
0922_285	Phoebe	 Ok. (they walk away together)
0922_286	David	 Do you smell beets?
0922_287	Phoebe	 Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
0922_288	<event>	Charlie and Rachel arrive. They see David and Phoebe leave
0922_289	Charlie	 Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
0922_290	Rachel	 No, that's David.
0922_291	Charlie	 There's a third guy?
0922_292	Rachel	 (disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
0922_293	<scene>	Cut to Monica and Chandler's
0922_294	Zack	 I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
0922_295	Chandler	 You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
0922_296	Zack	 No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
0922_297	Chandler	 Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
0922_298	Zack	 No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
0922_299	Chandler	 Ok.
0922_300	<event>	Zack leaves
0922_301	Chandler	 I think we've found our sperm!
0922_302	Monica	 Does seem pretty perfect.
0922_303	Chandler	 Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
0922_304	Monica	 (pause) No.
0922_305	Chandler	 Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
0922_306	Monica	 No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
0922_307	Chandler	 Yeah, he's better!
0922_308	Monica	 No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
0922_309	Chandler	 Really? Are you sure?
0922_310	Monica	 Yeah, I'm sure.
0922_311	Chandler	 (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
0922_312	Monica	 That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
0922_313	Chandler	 So you know this leaves us with...
0922_314	Monica	 Adoption.
0922_315	Chandler	 How do you feel about that?
0922_316	Monica	 I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
0922_317	Chandler	 Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
0922_318	Monica	 So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
0922_319	Chandler	 (smiling) Yeah.
0922_320	Monica	 (excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
0922_321	Chandler	 We are gonna be great parents.
0922_322	Monica	 And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
0922_323	Chandler	 Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!

0922_327	Chandler	 Hey, Zack!
0922_328	Zack	 (hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.
0922_329	Chandler	 Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
0922_330	Zack	 No you didn't.
0922_331	Chandler	 Really?
0922_332	Zack	 No you did.
0922_333	Chandler	 My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
0922_334	<event>	Zack's pregnant secretary, Jeanette, walks in
0922_335	Jeanette	 (to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).
0922_336	Zack	 Oh, thank you.

1005_003	Rachel	 You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
1005_004	Joey	 Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
1005_005	Rachel	 I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
1005_006	Joey	 No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
1005_007	Monica	 Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
1005_008	Rachel	 Of course, I'd be honored!
1005_009	Chandler	 Thanks!
1005_010	Monica	 Thank you!
1005_011	<event>	Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision
1005_012	Joey	 U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
1005_013	Chandler	 Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
1005_014	Monica	 Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
1005_015	Joey	 Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
1005_016	Monica	 Clearly we were wrong.
1005_017	Joey	 I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
1005_018	Monica	 You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
1005_019	Joey	 Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
1005_020	Chandler	 So excited about your letter!
1005_021	<event>	Phoebe enters

1005_026	Phoebe	 Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
1005_027	Rachel	 OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
1005_028	Phoebe	 YEAH!
1005_029	Chandler	 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
1005_030	Phoebe	 Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
1005_031	Joey	 Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
1005_032	Phoebe	 Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
1005_033	Monica	 You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
1005_034	Chandler	 That's where people make number two!!

1005_039	Ross	 Hey...
1005_040	Charlie	 So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
1005_041	Ross	 (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
1005_042	Charlie	 Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...
1005_043	Ross	 (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!
1005_044	Charlie	 Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
1005_045	Ross	 Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
1005_046	<event>	they start kissing but someone knocks at the door
1005_047	Ross	 Damnit!
1005_048	Amy	 (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!
1005_049	Ross	 (he opens the door) Hi Amy!
1005_050	Amy	 You're not Rachel.
1005_051	Ross	 Still sharp as a tack!
1005_052	Amy	 Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
1005_053	Charlie	 Hi!
1005_054	Amy	 Hi!
1005_055	Charlie	 Nice to meet you.
1005_056	Amy	 H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?
1005_057	Ross	 (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
1005_058	Amy	 (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
1005_059	Ross	 (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.

1005_066	Amy	 Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
1005_067	Joey	 That's right, yeah.
1005_068	Amy	 You're not good!
1005_069	Joey	 Always nice to meet a fan!
1005_070	Rachel	 So now, what are you doing here?
1005_071	Amy	 Well, I have huge news.
1005_072	Rachel	 (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
1005_073	Amy	 Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)
1005_074	Ross	 Ehm... Her name is Emma .
1005_075	Amy	 Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
1005_076	Ross	 What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
1005_077	Amy	 Hey, your English is getting better!!
1005_078	Ross	 (to Joey) Oh my God!
1005_079	Joey	 I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
1005_080	Ross	 What... what you working on?
1005_081	Joey	 (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
1005_082	Ross	 Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
1005_083	Joey	 What did I just say?
1005_084	Ross	 Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
1005_085	Joey	 Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
1005_087	<scene>	Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing behind her.
1005_089	Rachel	 God!
1005_090	Amy	 So beautiful.
1005_091	Rachel	 Oh, I know, isn't she?
1005_092	Amy	 No, I was talking about your bedding.
1005_093	Rachel	 All right. What's your news, Amy?
1005_094	Amy	 Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
1005_095	Rachel	 What? Oh my God! To who?
1005_096	Amy	 This guy! He has a killer apartment.
1005_097	Rachel	 A-And??
1005_098	Amy	 A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
1005_099	Rachel	 No, what's he like?
1005_100	Amy	 Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
1005_101	Rachel	 Yeah.
1005_102	Amy	 It's his dad.
1005_103	Rachel	 Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
1005_104	Amy	 Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
1005_105	Rachel	 Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
1005_106	Amy	 Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
1005_107	Rachel	 Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didnt love. Do you remember Barry?
1005_108	Amy	 Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
1005_109	Rachel	 Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart , that is fun and that you care about!
1005_110	Amy	 (thinks about it) Youre right, youre right! Im gonna do it!
1005_111	Rachel	 Ok.
1005_112	Amy	 Im gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
1005_113	Rachel	 Ok, lets keep talking.

1005_117	Phoebe	 Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... theyre in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Cant believe it's been a whole year!
1005_118	Mike	 I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
1005_119	Phoebe	 ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
1005_120	Mike	 I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
1005_121	Phoebe	 YOURE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) ITS OUR ANNIVERSARY!
1005_122	Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen theres written Julie, will you marry me? and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)
1005_123	Phoebe	 Oh how lame... oh, its so tacky, and impersonal.
1005_124	Mike	 Really?
1005_125	Phoebe	 Oh, its the worst way to propose!
1005_126	Mike	 (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).
1005_128	<scene>	Monicas apartment. Joey enters the room
1005_130	Joey	 Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think youll be very, very happy. Its the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
1005_131	Chandler	 (reading) I dont... uh... understand.
1005_132	Joey	 (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
1005_133	Monica	 (also reading it) It doesnt make any sense.
1005_134	Joey	 Of course it does! Its smart! I used the the-saurus!
1005_135	Chandler	 On every word?
1005_136	Joey	 Yep!
1005_137	Monica	 Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)
1005_138	Joey	 Oh, They are warm, nice, people with big hearts.
1005_139	Chandler	 And that became they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
1005_140	Joey	 Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
1005_141	Monica	 Hey Joey, I dont think we can use this.
1005_142	Joey	 Why not?
1005_143	Monica	 Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-whats-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why dont you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
1005_144	Chandler	 You know what? You dont need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
1005_146	<scene>	The corridor. Amy knocks Joeys door and Rachel opens the door.
1005_148	Rachel	 Amy, hi!
1005_149	Amy	 I took your advice, I left Myron.
1005_150	Rachel	 Oh, good for you!
1005_151	Amy	 I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
1005_152	Rachel	 Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
1005_153	Amy	 Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
1005_154	Rachel	 But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
1005_155	<event>	Joey comes out of Monicas apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does not notice the huge amount of bags
1005_156	Joey	 Ah, look whos back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
1005_157	Amy	 Well, Im staying with you guys!
1005_158	Joey	 What?
1005_159	Amy	 Were gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!
1005_161	<scene>	Joeys apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.
1005_163	Joey	 You slept out here?
1005_164	Rachel	 Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling Myron, get off!
1005_165	Joey	 But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me were getting rid of her.
1005_166	Rachel	 Joey, I cant do that!
1005_167	Joey	 Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I dont need that kind of talk in my house!
1005_168	Rachel	 Well Joey, uhm look, I know that shes difficult, but I think its really good that shes here.
1005_169	Joey	 'Cause we will appreciate it more when shes gone?
1005_170	Rachel	 No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
1005_171	Joey	 Yeah, Monica made us!
1005_172	Rachel	 Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I dont think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnt for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know its gonna take patience, but thats ok.
1005_173	Amy	 Good morning.
1005_174	Joey	 Yeaah.
1005_175	Rachel	 Amy, thats what I was supposed to wear today, thats why I hung it on the door.
1005_176	Amy	 Oh, sweety, you cant pull this off.
1005_177	Rachel	 Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
1005_178	Amy	 Oh, I cant, honey. Im gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
1005_179	Joey	 (yelling at her) IM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
1005_181	<scene>	Monicas Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there, Phoebe enters the room
1005_183	Phoebe	 Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
1005_184	Chandler	 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
1005_185	Monica	 Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
1005_186	Ross	 Seriously?
1005_187	Chandler	 Word!
1005_188	Phoebe	 Well, mine was worse than that.
1005_189	Rachel	 Well, what happened?
1005_190	Phoebe	 We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
1005_191	Rachel	 Oh, that is so tacky.
1005_192	Phoebe	 Well, thats what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
1005_193	Monica	 Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
1005_194	Rachel	 Phoebe, thats huge!
1005_195	Ross	 Well, do you wanna marry him?
1005_196	Phoebe	 Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I dont think hes ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
1005_197	Chandler	 She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?
1005_198	Monica	 Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
1005_199	Phoebe	 Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
1005_200	Monica	 I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...
1005_201	Chandler	 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
1005_202	Monica	 Thank you.
1005_203	Phoebe	 (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?
1005_204	Rachel	 I think it could be kind of great!
1005_205	Ross	 Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
1005_206	Phoebe	 Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
1005_207	Monica	 How about at a game, on the big screen?
1005_208	Rachel	 (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)
1005_209	Monica	 What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
1005_210	Phoebe	 Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?
1005_211	Chandler	 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
1005_212	<event>	Amy walks in carrying a phone handset
1005_213	Amy	 (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)
1005_214	Rachel	 (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
1005_215	Amy	 She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
1005_216	Rachel	 (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
1005_217	Ross	 No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
1005_218	Rachel	 Menstrual cramps.
1005_219	Ross	 I don't think that's what this is.
1005_220	Rachel	 (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?
1005_221	Monica	 No, sorry sweety..
1005_222	Phoebe	 No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
1005_223	Rachel	 (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
1005_224	Amy	 Well, I can do it.
1005_225	Rachel	 (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...
1005_226	Ross	 (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
1005_227	Rachel	 Yeah.
1005_228	Ross	 Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
1005_229	Rachel	 Why not?
1005_230	Ross	 Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella! Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
1005_231	Ross	 Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
1005_232	Rachel	 (Shocked) Wha... the next one?
1005_233	Ross	 (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
1005_234	Rachel	 Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
1005_235	Ross	 I... I don't know..
1005_236	Rachel	 Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
1005_237	<event>	Amy approaches from behind
1005_238	Amy	 um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)
1005_239	<event>	Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently
1005_240	Rachel	 Absolutely.
1005_241	Amy	 (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)
1005_243	<scene>	Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.
1005_245	Chandler	 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
1005_246	Joey	 Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
1005_247	<event>	Chandler and Monica look shocked
1005_248	Monica	 You dropped it off?
1005_249	Joey	 Yeah.
1005_250	Chandler	 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
1005_251	Joey	 No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)
1005_252	Monica	 You hand-wrote it?
1005_253	Joey	 Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all ! See ya later! (Leaves)
1005_254	Monica	 Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
1005_255	Chandler	 It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
1005_256	Monica	 Okay good.
1005_257	Chandler	 (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
1005_258	Monica	 Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
1005_259	Chandler	 (Still looks confused) They loved it.
1005_260	Monica	 What?
1005_261	Chandler	 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
1005_262	Monica	 (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?
1005_263	Chandler	 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings .
1005_264	<event>	Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller
1005_265	Amy	 Hi!
1005_266	Monica	 Hey, what did you guys do today?
1005_267	Amy	 Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
1005_268	Chandler	 That sounds like fun.
1005_269	Amy	 Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
1005_270	<event>	Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma
1005_271	Rachel	 (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
1005_272	Amy	 I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
1005_273	Rachel	 (sounds excited) Yeah!
1005_274	<event>	Amy takes off Emma's hat
1005_275	Amy	 Ta-daaa!
1005_276	<event>	Rachel looks at Emma
1005_277	Rachel	 (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?
1005_278	Amy	 (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
1005_279	<event>	Rachel looks very shocked
1005_281	Rachel	 You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
1005_282	Amy	 Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
1005_283	Chandler	 I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!
1005_284	Rachel	 Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
1005_285	Amy	 Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
1005_286	Rachel	 Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)
1005_287	<event>	Ross enters
1005_288	Ross	 Hey guys. Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.
1005_289	Ross	 Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).
1005_290	Rachel	 Nah, I don't really want her to see.
1005_291	Ross	 Why not?
1005_292	Monica	 Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
1005_293	Chandler	 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
1005_294	Ross	 Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!
1005_295	<event>	Rachel looks worried
1005_296	Ross	 (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?
1005_297	Rachel	 Nothing.
1005_298	Ross	 (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.
1005_299	Rachel	 Oh, they're real!
1005_300	Ross	 Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
1005_301	Rachel	 I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
1005_302	Amy	 Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
1005_303	Monica	 I'm a cool, fun aunt!
1005_304	Amy	 (Sarcastically) O-Okay!
1005_305	Chandler	 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
1005_306	Rachel	 I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
1005_307	Amy	 Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
1005_308	Rachel	 Oh yeah? Since when?
1005_309	Amy	 Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
1005_310	Rachel	 (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?
1005_311	Ross	 That's not a thing !
1005_312	Amy	 Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
1005_313	Rachel	 (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.
1005_314	Amy	 Enter Amy!
1005_315	Ross	 (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
1005_316	Amy	 What? What are you gonna do?
1005_317	Ross	 (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!
1005_318	<event>	Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who gestures "later".
1005_320	<scene>	Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.
1005_322	Mike	 Great game, huh?
1005_323	Phoebe	 Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
1005_324	Mike	 Why do you keep looking at the screen?
1005_325	Phoebe	 I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?
1005_326	Mike	 Going go to the bathroom.
1005_327	Phoebe	 Well, I think you should wait.
1005_328	Mike	 Why?
1005_329	Phoebe	 Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
1005_330	Announcer	 Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
1005_331	<event>	We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.
1005_332	Phoebe	 Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)
1005_333	Announcer	 Get a load of this... She's proposing to him . Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)
1005_334	Phoebe	 That's not very enlightened!
1005_335	<event>	There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him
1005_336	Phoebe	 Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!
1005_338	<scene>	Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone rings.
1005_340	Joey	 (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!
1005_341	<event>	Rachel and Amy enter
1005_342	Rachel	 Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
1005_343	Joey	 Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)
1005_344	Amy	 You're kicking me out?
1005_345	Rachel	 You put holes in my baby's ears!
1005_346	Amy	 Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl !
1005_347	Rachel	 (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
1005_348	Amy	 You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
1005_349	Rachel	 Excuse me?
1005_350	Amy	 You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?
1005_351	Rachel	 (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?
1005_352	Joey	 (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!
1005_353	Amy	 You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
1005_354	Rachel	 (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?
1005_355	Amy	 hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
1005_356	Rachel	 Hips or thighs?
1005_357	Amy	 Ass and face.
1005_358	Rachel	 (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
1005_359	Amy	 She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
1005_360	Rachel	 (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.
1005_361	Amy	 You can?
1005_362	Rachel	 Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
1005_363	Amy	 (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
1005_364	Rachel	 Did you just say Emma?
1005_365	Amy	 Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
1005_366	<scene>	Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.
1005_368	Phoebe	 That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
1005_369	Mike	 But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
1005_370	Phoebe	 (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
1005_371	<event>	Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.
1005_372	Phoebe	 It's in the cake, isn't it?
1005_373	Mike	 (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)
1005_374	Phoebe	 What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
1005_375	Mike	 No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
1005_376	<event>	Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face
1005_377	Mike	 I'm gonna do this now .
1005_378	Phoebe	 Oh my God!
1005_379	<event>	Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.
1005_380	Mike	 Phoebe, I...
1005_381	Phoebe	 Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
1005_382	Mike	 Ready?
1005_383	Phoebe	 Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)
1005_384	Mike	 Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
1005_385	Phoebe	 Yes!
1005_386	<event>	Mike puts the ring on her finger
1005_387	Mike	 I love you!
1005_388	Phoebe	 I love you more!
1005_389	Mike	 Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
1005_390	<event>	They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.
1005_393	<scene>	The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are walking on the sidewalk.
1005_395	Rachel	 So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
1005_396	Amy	 Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
1005_397	Rachel	 That's shocking!
1005_398	Amy	 Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!
1014_001	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are having a diner party with Phoebe and Mike.
1014_002	Mike	 (raising his glass) Thank you guys for having us over.
1014_003	Phoebe	 Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
1014_004	Chandler	 Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
1014_005	Monica	 Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
1014_006	Chandler	 You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
1014_007	Ross	 (entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news.
1014_008	Monica	 Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
1014_009	Ross	 Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today...
1014_010	Chandler	 A dinosaur died a million years ago?
1014_011	Ross	 Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
1014_012	Phoebe	 Wow!
1014_013	Ross	 Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid .
1014_014	Rachel	 (while entering) Hi you guys.
1014_015	All	 Hey.
1014_016	Rachel	 Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
1014_017	Monica	 No one wanted seconds, right?
1014_018	Ross	 No, no. I-I'm good.
1014_019	Rachel	 Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me .
1014_020	Ross	 I'm up for tenure.
1014_021	Rachel	 Congratulations!
1014_022	Ross	 You too! What are the odds?
1014_023	Rachel	 Ooh! (they hug)
1014_024	Joey	 (enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
1014_025	Monica	 I don't know who I'm happiest for...
1014_026	Phoebe	 I do , he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)
1014_029	<scene>	Central Perk. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler on their couch.
1014_030	Phoebe	 Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
1014_031	Monica	 No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)
1014_032	Phoebe	 Where did you go to do it?
1014_033	Monica	 Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
1014_034	Chandler	 YOU NEVER DID IT!
1014_035	Monica	 I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
1014_036	Chandler	 Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
1014_037	Mike	 (walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here you go.
1014_038	Phoebe	 Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
1014_039	Mike	 Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
1014_040	Phoebe	 All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
1014_041	Chandler	 Mrs Hannigan?
1014_042	Phoebe	 What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
1014_043	Joey	 (enters) Hey guys.
1014_044	Chandler	 Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
1014_045	Joey	 No, thank you.
1014_046	Monica	 All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
1014_047	Chandler	 Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
1014_048	Joey	 But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
1014_049	Monica	 Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
1014_050	Joey	 You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
1014_051	Chandler	 Damn it.
1014_052	Monica	 See you guys later.
1014_053	Phoebe	 Okay!
1014_054	Monica	 (to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
1014_055	Phoebe	 Good for you. That was really mature.
1014_056	Joey	 What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
1014_057	Mike	 You're a strange kind of grown-up.
1014_058	Phoebe	 Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
1014_059	Mike	 Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
1014_060	Phoebe	 All right, prude ... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
1014_061	Joey	 Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
1014_062	<event>	Phoebe whispers something in Joey's ear, but after hearing it he jumps up, shocked
1014_063	Joey	 I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)
1014_065	<scene>	A restaurant. Rachel enters.
1014_066	Rachel	 (to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gu kk i, which could be confusing.
1014_067	Maitre D'	 Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
1014_068	<event>	They walk to the table, but Rachel suddenly gasps. Sitting there is mr Zellner, her boss from her current job at Ralph Lauren.
1014_069	Rachel	 Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
1014_070	Maitre D'	 I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
1014_071	Rachel	 But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
1014_072	Maitre D'	 I know. With Gu kk i
1014_073	Rachel	 Sssshhhh!
1014_074	Mr Zellner	 Rachel?
1014_075	Rachel	 Hi... I'm on a date...
1014_076	Mr Zellner	 (confused) That's great!
1014_077	Rachel	 Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
1014_078	Mr Zellner	 Well, you got uhm... good energy.
1014_079	Rachel	 Oh.
1014_080	Mr Campbell	 Rachel?
1014_081	Rachel	 Yes, hi!
1014_082	Mr Campbell	 James Campbell...
1014_083	Rachel	 Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
1014_084	Mr Campbell	 Please... (shows her to sit)
1014_085	Rachel	 Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!
1014_086	Mr Campbell	 So... your resum is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs)
1014_087	Rachel	 Wha... My resum? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resum.
1014_088	Mr Campbell	 Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resum.
1014_089	Rachel	 (starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
1014_090	Mr Campbell	 Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
1014_091	Rachel	 What? I-I don't.
1014_092	Mr Campbell	 You don't?
1014_093	Rachel	 No, I-I-I love it there.
1014_094	Mr Campbell	 Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
1014_095	<event>	Rachel mimes and mouths to mr Campbell "That is my boss", pointing to mr Zellner
1014_096	Mr Campbell	 What?
1014_097	<event>	Rachel now silently whispers "That's my boss".
1014_098	Mr Campbell	 That's Hugo Boss?
1014_099	<event>	Rachel holds her hand in order to support her head. Mr Zellner obviously overheard the conversation.
1014_101	<scene>	A counter at a government building. Phoebe's waiting in line.
1014_102	Phoebe	 (to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.
1014_103	Clerk	 How can I help you?
1014_104	Phoebe	 I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.
1014_105	Clerk	 You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line)
1014_106	Phoebe	 Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
1014_107	Clerk	 It can be anything you want.
1014_108	Phoebe	 Well, not anything , I mean...
1014_109	Clerk	 Yeah... anything .
1014_110	Phoebe	 Oh, this could take a while.
1014_111	Clerk	 Get out of my line.
1014_112	Phoebe	 Okay.
1014_114	<scene>	Central Perk. Chandler and Monica are there when Phoebe enters.
1014_115	Phoebe	 Hey!
1014_116	Monica	 Hey Pheebs.
1014_117	Phoebe	 Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
1014_118	Monica	 Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
1014_119	Phoebe	 Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
1014_120	Chandler	 That's what we were gonna name the baby.
1014_121	Monica	 Phoebe!
1014_122	Phoebe	 Uh! Princess Consuela.
1014_123	Monica	 You seriously changed your name to that?
1014_124	Phoebe	 Uh-huh!
1014_125	Monica	 Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
1014_126	Phoebe	 Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
1014_127	<event>	Rachel enters, looking depressed
1014_128	Chandler	 Hey, how'd the interview go?
1014_129	Rachel	 Oh! It's not good.
1014_130	Chandler	 You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
1014_131	Rachel	 Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
1014_132	Chandler	 That is a bad interview.
1014_133	Phoebe	 What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
1014_134	Rachel	 Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
1014_135	Monica	 Oh God. I'm so sorry.
1014_136	<event>	Ross enters with a bottle in his hand
1014_137	Ross	 Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
1014_138	Phoebe	 Ross...
1014_139	Ross	 I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
1014_140	All (Except Rachel)	 Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
1014_141	Ross	 This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
1014_142	Gunther	 Six? You want me to join you?
1014_143	Ross	 Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
1014_144	Chandler	 Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
1014_145	Ross	 I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
1014_146	Rachel	 Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
1014_147	Ross	 Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
1014_148	Phoebe	 Can you?
1014_149	Rachel	 Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
1014_150	Ross	 And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
1014_151	Phoebe	 And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths "aah")
1014_152	Ross	 But also knowing it means a lot .
1014_153	Monica	 But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
1014_154	Ross	 ...that center around work.
1014_155	Chandler	 To Ross!
1014_156	All (Except Rachel)	 Ross!
1014_157	<event>	they all drink from the champagne, but clearly dislike the taste of it
1014_158	Ross	 You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
1014_159	Phoebe	 Oh God!
1014_160	Ross	 No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
1014_161	Rachel	 (crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
1014_162	Ross	 Rach, I'm so sorry.
1014_163	Rachel	 Oh!
1014_164	Ross	 Great. I feel like an idiot.
1014_165	Rachel	 No, it's okay, you didn't know.
1014_166	Ross	 Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
1014_168	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's future house. They enter the living room with the realtor and Joey.
1014_169	Monica	 Thank you for letting us see the house again.
1014_170	Chandler	 And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
1014_171	Realtor	 Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room)
1014_172	Monica	 Ah, so glad you decided to come.
1014_173	Joey	 Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
1014_174	Chandler	 What?
1014_175	Joey	 Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
1014_176	Monica	 No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
1014_177	Joey	 Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
1014_178	Monica	 Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
1014_179	Joey	 Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)
1014_180	Monica	 No it's not!
1014_181	Joey	 (squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
1014_182	Chandler	 When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
1014_183	Joey	 (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
1014_184	Monica	 Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
1014_185	Joey	 FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
1014_186	Monica	 Joey, we know that's you.
1014_187	Joey	 no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
1014_189	<scene>	Phoebe is at Central Perk. Mike enters.
1014_190	Mike	 Hey (He kisses Phoebe)
1014_191	Phoebe	 Welcome back!
1014_192	Mike	 Ah! I missed you
1014_193	Phoebe	 Oh, me too!
1014_194	Mike	 So, what's new?
1014_195	Phoebe	 Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
1014_196	Mike	 That's great! You changed you name?
1014_197	Phoebe	 Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She smiles from ear to ear)
1014_198	Mike	 (afraid) You're kidding right?
1014_199	Phoebe	 Nope.
1014_200	Mike	 You really did that?
1014_201	Phoebe	 Yep.
1014_202	Mike	 Yeah, but you can't do that.
1014_203	Phoebe	 Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
1014_204	Mike	 (looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
1014_205	Phoebe	 Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
1014_206	Mike	 Crap Bag.
1014_207	Phoebe	(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?
1014_208	Mike	 No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
1014_209	Phoebe	 You're not serious, right?
1014_210	Mike	 Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
1014_211	Phoebe	 Uhu, uhu, well, then, great . If you love it, I love it.
1014_212	Mike	 I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
1014_213	Phoebe	 And I love Crap.
1014_215	<scene>	Joey is in Monica and Chandler's future house, sitting in a child's bedroom, looking at a quiz card which has "5+10=" printed on one side.
1014_216	Joey	 (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!
1014_217	<event>	A young girl enters
1014_218	Girl	 Who are you?
1014_219	Joey	 Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
1014_220	Girl	 I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
1014_221	Joey	 (understanding) Oh.
1014_222	Mackenzie	 (sighs) I hate my parents.
1014_223	Joey	 I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
1014_224	Mackenzie	 Like what?
1014_225	Joey	 (thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
1014_226	Mackenzie	 What are you? Eight?
1014_227	Joey	 Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
1014_228	Mackenzie	 I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
1014_229	Joey	 (frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
1014_230	Mackenzie	 I really don't.
1014_231	Joey	 What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
1014_232	Mackenzie	 My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
1014_233	Joey	 Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
1014_234	Mackenzie	 This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
1014_235	Joey	 Yeah, yeah, I guess.
1014_236	Mackenzie	 Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
1014_237	Joey	 (having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.
1014_238	Mackenzie	 Then you gotta let them go.
1014_239	Joey	 (In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
1014_240	Mackenzie	 I read a lot.
1014_241	Joey	 (his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
1014_243	<scene>	Outside Ralph Lauren building. Rachel just walked out carrying a box of her stuff, and a strange man approaches her.
1014_244	Man	 Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
1014_245	Rachel	 Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
1014_246	Man	 You still don't know my name, do you?
1014_247	Rachel	 (Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)
1014_248	<event>	In the meantime, Ross is trying to squeeze and push a rather large chair through the revolving doors of the Ralph Lauren building.
1014_249	Rachel	 (annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?
1014_250	Ross	 (stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
1014_251	<event>	Mark, approaches from behind and recognizes her
1014_252	Mark	 Rachel?
1014_253	Rachel	 (turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
1014_254	Mark	 How've you been?
1014_255	Rachel	 I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
1014_256	Mark	 Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)
1014_257	Ross	 Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly)
1014_258	Mark	 Clever. (back to Rachel) So how are you?
1014_259	Rachel	 Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.
1014_260	Mark	 Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
1014_261	Rachel	 No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
1014_262	Mark	 Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
1014_263	Rachel	 Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
1014_264	Mark	 Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
1014_265	Rachel	 Great! I'll call ya!
1014_266	Mark	 (shakes Ross' hand) Nice to see you.
1014_267	Ross	 Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
1014_268	Rachel	 (very excited) Oh my God!
1014_269	Ross	 See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
1014_270	Rachel	 Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
1014_271	Ross	 (realizing) That is Mark?
1014_272	Rachel	 Yes.
1014_273	Ross	 I hate that guy.
1014_274	Rachel	 Oh.
1014_275	Ross	 No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
1014_276	Rachel	 What? You don't want me to get a job?
1014_277	Ross	 Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
1014_278	Rachel	 Ugh.
1014_279	Ross	 I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
1014_280	Rachel	 Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
1014_282	<scene>	Chandler and Monica's new house. Sitting near the window, they look at the neighborhood.
1014_283	Monica	 Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
1014_284	Chandler	 Man, those two dogs are going at it !
1014_285	Joey	 (entering) Hey!
1014_286	Chandler	 Hey.
1014_287	Monica	 Hey, where have you been?
1014_288	Joey	 Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
1014_289	Chandler	 Really? What changed your mind?
1014_290	Joey	 Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
1014_291	Chandler	 Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
1014_292	<event>	Joey's eyes double in size
1014_293	Joey	 (frightened) What?
1014_294	Chandler	 Ha! I'm just messing with you.
1014_295	Joey	 That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
1014_296	Monica	 Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
1014_297	Joey	 What? I get my own room?
1014_298	Chandler	 You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
1014_299	Joey	 Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
1014_300	Chandler And Monica	 No!
1014_301	Joey	 Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
1014_303	<scene>	Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are leaving.
1014_304	Mike	 After you, miss Banana Hammock.
1014_305	Phoebe	 Thank you, mister Bag.
1014_306	<event>	a woman enters and recognizes Phoebe
1014_307	Woman	 Oh hey, how are you?
1014_308	Phoebe	 Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage client.
1014_309	Mike	 Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
1014_310	Phoebe	 (shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.
1014_311	Rita	 Oh! (they shake hands)
1014_312	Phoebe	 Yeah.
1014_313	Mike	 Why don't you tell her my name?
1014_314	Phoebe	 (without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.
1014_315	Rita	 Crap Bag?
1014_316	Mike	 If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
1014_317	Rita	 Okay. Excuse me...
1014_318	Phoebe	 Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
1014_319	Mike	 Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
1014_320	Phoebe	 How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
1014_321	Mike	 Really?
1014_322	Phoebe	 Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
1014_323	Mike	 Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
1014_324	Phoebe	 It's a funny word.
1014_325	Mike	 It's a Speedo.
1014_326	Phoebe	 ...Oh crap!
1014_328	<scene>	Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross enters.
1014_329	Ross	 Hey, is Rachel here?
1014_330	Monica	 No.
1014_331	Ross	 She's still at dinner?
1014_332	Monica	 I guess. Why? Who's she with?
1014_333	Ross	 That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
1014_334	Chandler	 It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
1014_335	Ross	 We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
1014_336	Monica	 So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
1014_337	Chandler	 Excuse me?
1014_338	Monica	 Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time .
1014_339	Chandler	 For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
1014_340	Monica	 Oh, sorry!
1014_341	<event>	She looks at Ross, a bit ashamed. Chandler mimes "big breasts" to Ross and lip syncs "Wow". Ross looks at him, astonished and then Monica looks at Chandler again. A little too late he changes the "big breasts" mime into "rocking a baby". When he realizes Monica might have seen it he also strokes his imaginary baby's head.
1014_342	Rachel	 (entering) Hi you guys!
1014_343	Ross	 Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
1014_344	Rachel	 Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet .
1014_345	Ross	 (speaking without pause, agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
1014_346	Rachel	 Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
1014_347	Ross	 Should we send something?
1014_348	Chandler	 How did the job stuff go?
1014_349	Rachel	 He offered me one.
1014_350	Chandler	 That's great!
1014_351	Ross	 Congratulations!
1014_352	Rachel	 I know, it's amazing . It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great ...
1014_353	Ross	 Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
1014_354	Rachel	 The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
1014_357	<scene>	Joey and Rachel's. Joey's on the phone.
1014_358	Joey	 I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
1014_359	Mackenzie	 (at the other end of the line) I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)
1014_360	Joey	 Hey bear, I need some career advice.
