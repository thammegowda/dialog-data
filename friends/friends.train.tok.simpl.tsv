0102_002	monica	what you guys don 't understand is , for us , kissing is as important as any part of it .
0102_003	joey	yeah , right y 'serious ?
0102_004	phoebe	oh , yeah
0102_005	rachel	everything you need to know is in that first kiss .
0102_006	monica	absolutely .
0102_007	chandler	yeah , i think for us , kissing is pretty much like an opening act , y 'know ? i mean it 's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .
0102_008	ross	yeah , and-and it 's not that we don 't like the comedian , it 's that-that that 's not why we bought the ticket .
0102_009	chandler	the problem is , though , after the concert 's over , no matter how great the show was , you girls are always looking for the comedian again , y 'know ? i mean , we 're in the car , we 're fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake .
0102_010	rachel	yeah , well , word of advice bring back the comedian . otherwise next time you 're gonna find yourself sitting at home , listening to that album alone .
0102_011	joey	are we still talking about sex ?

0102_014	ross	no , it 's good , it is good , it 's just that- mm- doesn 't she seem a little angry ?
0102_015	marsha	well , she has issues .
0102_016	ross	does she .
0102_017	marsha	he 's out banging other women over the head with a club , while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet
0102_018	ross	marsha , these are cave people . okay ? they have issues like gee , that glacier 's getting kinda close . see ?
0102_019	marsha	speaking of issues , isn 't that your ex-wife ?

0102_040	joey	yeah , sorry , the swallowing slowed me down .
0102_041	monica	whose little ball of paper is this ?
0102_042	chandler	oh , uh , that would be mine . see , i wrote a note to myself , and then i realised i didn 't need it , so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead .

0102_044	phoebe	she 's already fluffed that pillow monica , you know , you 've already fluffed that- -but , it 's fine
0102_045	monica	look , i 'm sorry , guys , i just don 't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have .
0102_046	chandler	yes , and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child 's pillow .
0102_047	phoebe	monica- hi um , monica , you 're scaring me . i mean , you 're like , you 're like all chaotic and twirly . and not-not in a good way .
0102_048	joey	yeah , calm down . you don 't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .
0102_049	monica	that 's because as far as my parents are concerned , ross can do no wrong . y 'see , he 's the prince . apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born .

0102_083	rachel	well now , how-how do you fit into this whole thing ?
0102_084	ross	well , carol says she and susan want me to be involved , but if i 'm not comfortable with it , i don 't have to be involved basically it 's entirely up to me .
0102_085	phoebe	she is so great i miss her .
0102_086	monica	what does she mean by involved ?
0102_087	chandler	i mean presumably , the biggest part of your job is done .

0102_089	rachel	so what are you gonna do ?

0102_100	ross	aw , mom
0102_101	monica	i 'm sorry , why is this girl going to call me ?
0102_102	mrs. geller	oh , she just graduated , and she wants to be something in cooking , or food , or i don 't know . anyway , i told her you had a restaurant-
0102_103	monica	no mom , i don 't have a restaurant , i work in a restaurant .
0102_104	mrs. geller	well , they don 't have to know that
0102_105	monica	ross , could you come and help me with the spaghetti , please ?
0102_106	ross	yeah .
0102_107	mrs. geller	oh , we 're having spaghetti that 's easy .
0102_108	monica	i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish , but , were you planning on bringing up the whole baby lesbian thing ? because i think it might take some of the heat off me .

0102_110	mrs. geller	what that rachel did to her life we ran into her parents at the club , they were not playing very well .
0102_111	mr. geller	i 'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money
0102_112	mrs. geller	well , at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar
0102_113	monica	what 's that supposed to mean ?
0102_114	mrs. geller	nothing it 's an expression .
0102_115	monica	no it 's not .
0102_116	mr. geller	don 't listen to your mother . you 're independent , and you always have been even when you were a kid and you were chubby , and you had no friends , you were just fine and you would read alone in your room , and your puzzles

0102_118	mr. geller	look , there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars , with his museum , and his papers getting published . other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i 'm telling you , these are the people who never get cancer .

0102_120	mr. geller	and i read about these women trying to have it all , and i thank god our little harmonica doesn 't seem to have that problem .
0102_121	monica	so , ross , what 's going on with you ? any stories ? no news , no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?
0102_122	ross	okay okay . look , i , uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me , and , so , well , here 's the deal . carol 's a lesbian . she 's living with a woman named susan . she 's pregnant with my child , and she and susan are

0102_130	ross	must pee .
0102_131	phoebe	y 'know , it 's even worse when you 're twins .
0102_132	rachel	you 're twins ?
0102_133	phoebe	yeah . we don 't speak . she 's like this high-powered , driven career type .
0102_134	chandler	what does she do ?

0102_151	ross	well , you may wanna steer clear of the word dumped . chances are he 's gonna be this , this broken shell of a man , y 'know , so you should try not to look too terrific , i know it 'll be hard . or , y 'know , uh , hey , i 'll go down

0103_007	rachel	what ? he said we should do it again , that 's good , right ?
0103_008	monica	uh , no . loosely translated we should do this again means you will never see me naked .
0103_009	rachel	since when ?
0103_010	joey	since always . it 's like dating language . y 'know , like it 's not you means it is you .
0103_011	chandler	or you 're such a nice guy means i 'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you .
0103_012	phoebe	or , or , y 'know , um , i think we should see other people means ha , ha , i already am .
0103_013	rachel	and everybody knows this ?
0103_014	joey	yeah . cushions the blow .
0103_015	chandler	yeah , it 's like when you 're a kid , and your parents put your dog to sleep , and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .
0103_016	ross	that 's funny , that , no , because , uh , our parents actually did , uh , send our dog off to live on a farm .
0103_017	monica	uh , ross .
0103_018	ross	what ? wh- hello ? the millners farm in connecticut ? the millners , they had this unbelievable farm , they had horses , and , and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- oh my god , chi chi

0103_021	chandler	so how does it feel knowing you 're about to die ?
0103_022	joey	warden , in five minutes my pain will be over . but you 'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die .
0103_023	chandler	hey , that was really good

0103_027	chandler	smoke away .

0110_056	max	hard quality .
0110_057	david	-hard quality . and uh , while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way , you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace . then , uh , that-that-that 's when you started yelling .

0110_088	chandler	y 'know , if you 're gonna work late , i could look in on him for you .
0110_089	ross	oh , that 'd be great okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you 're there to see him , okay , and you 're not like doing it as a favour to me .
0110_090	chandler	okay , but if he asks , i 'm not going to lie .

0110_092	david	but , you can 't actually test this theory , because today 's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .

0113_073	mr. tribbiani	of course , course one of em 's ma . what 's the matter with you .

0113_075	joey	it 's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life . he 's like actually some spy , working for the c.i.a. that 'd be cool this blows
0113_076	rachel	i know , i mean , why can 't parents just stay parents ? why do they have to become people ? why do they have why can 't you stop staring at my breasts ?

0113_079	ross	alright , alright . we 're all adults here , there 's only one way to resolve this . since you saw her boobies , i think , uh , you 're gonna have to show her your peepee .

0113_090	ross	yeah .
0113_091	chandler	oh , it 's nothing , it 's a little thing i hate that guy .
0113_092	ross	what , so he was a little analytical . that 's what he does , y 'know ? c 'mon , he 's not that bad .

0113_094	ross	y 'see , that 's where you 're wrong . why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian ?
0113_095	roger	i dunno . maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .
0113_096	ross	why ? why would i why ? why ? why ? why ?
0113_097	roger	i don 't know . maybe maybe low self-esteem , maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling , maybe you
0113_098	monica	wait-wait , go back to that sibling thing .
0113_099	roger	well , i don 't know . i mean , it 's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents .
0113_100	ross	that that 's ridiculous i don 't feel guilty for her failures
0113_101	monica	oh so you think i 'm a failure

0113_103	ross	nonono , thatthat 's not what i was saying
0113_104	monica	y 'know , all these years , i thought you were on my side . but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they 'd keep liking you better
0113_105	ross	hey , i married a lesbian to make you look good

0113_107	rachel	you 're right i mean you 're right it wasn 't just the weebles , but it was the weeble play palace , and and the weebles cruise ship . oh , which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .

0113_218	joey	oww big ring
0113_219	mrs. tribbiani	why did you have to fill your father 's head with all that garbage about making things right ? things were fine the way they were there 's chicken in there , put it away . for god 's sake , joey , really .
0113_220	joey	hold on , you-you knew ?
0113_221	mrs. tribbiani	of course i knew what did you think ? your father is no james bond . you should 've heard some of his cover stories . i 'm sleeping over at my accountant 's , i mean , what is that ? please
0113_222	joey	so then how could you i mean , how could you ?
0113_223	mrs. tribbiani	do you remember how your father used to be ? always yelling , always yelling nothing made him happy , nothing made him happy , not that wood shop , not those stupid little ships in the bottle , nothing . now he 's happy i mean , it 's nice , he has a hobby .
0113_224	joey	ma , i don 't mean to be disrespectful , but what the hell are you talking about ? i mean , what about you ?
0113_225	mrs. tribbiani	me ? i 'm fine . look , honey , in an ideal world , there 'd be no her , and your father would look like sting . and i 'll tell you something else . ever since that poodle-stuffer came along , he 's been so ashamed of himself that he 's been more attentive , he 's
0113_226	joey	i 'm happy for you ?
0113_227	mrs. tribbiani	well don 't be , because now everything 's screwed up . i just want it the way it was .
0113_228	joey	ma , i 'm sorry . i just did what i thought you 'd want .
0113_229	mrs. tribbiani	i know you did , cookie . oh , i know you did . so tell me . did you see her ?

0113_232	joey	with this ring ? no contest .

0113_234	roger	what 's wrong , sweetie ?
0113_235	phoebe	nothing , nothing .
0113_236	roger	aaaah , what 's wrong , c 'mon .
0113_237	phoebe	it 's , i mean , it 's nothing , i 'm fine . it 's my friends . they-they have a liking problem with you . in that , um , they don 't .
0113_238	roger	oh . they don 't .
0113_239	phoebe	but they don 't see all the wonderfulness that i see . they don 't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff . they just think you 're a little
0113_240	roger	what ?
0113_241	phoebe	intense and creepy .
0113_242	roger	oh .
0113_243	phoebe	but i don 't . me , phoebe .
0113_244	roger	well , i 'm not i 'm not at all surprised they feel that way .
0113_245	phoebe	you 're not ? see , that 's why you 're so great
0113_246	roger	actually it 's , it 's quite , y 'know , typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic . y 'know , this kind of co-dependant , emotionally stunted , sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which , i 'm sorry , might as well have nipples on them , and

0113_248	monica	so you talked to your dad , huh .
0113_249	joey	yeah . he 's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted , she 's gonna keep pretending she doesn 't know even though she does , and my little sister tina can 't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today .
0113_250	rachel	wow .
0113_251	chandler	things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .
0113_252	ross	so joey , you okay ?
0113_253	joey	yeah , i guess . it 's just parents , after a certain point , you gotta let go . even if you know better , you 've gotta let them make their own mistakes .
0113_254	rachel	just think , in a couple of years we get to turn into them .
0113_255	chandler	if i turn into my parents , i 'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys , or i 'll end up like my mom .
0113_256	phoebe	hey .

0113_264	phoebe	i don 't know , i mean , he 's a good person , and he can be really sweet , and in some ways i think he is so right for me , it 's just i hate that guy

0121_111	ross	i know . i know . i mean , one day , he 's this little thing , and before you know it , he 's this little thing i can 't get off my leg .
0121_112	joey	isn 't there any way you can keep him ?
0121_113	ross	no , no . the vet says unless he 's in a place where he has regular access to some monkey lovin , he 's just gonna get vicious . i 've just gotta get him into a zoo .
0121_114	joey	how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
0121_115	chandler	i know that one no , that 's popes into a volkswagen .
0121_116	ross	well , we 're applying to a lot of them . naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos , y 'know , like , uh , san diego right ? but that might just be a pipe dream , because , y 'know , he 's out of state . uh , my vet ,
0121_117	chandler	yeah , but that 's like two blocks away from the beach . i mean , it 's a total party zoo .

0121_119	phoebe	hey . we found her , we found the girl .
0121_120	chandler	what ?
0121_121	joey	did you call the cops ?
0121_122	rachel	nope . we took her to lunch .
0121_123	chandler	ah . your own brand of vigilante justice .
0121_124	ross	what ? are you insane ? this woman stole from you . she stole . she 's a stealer .
0121_125	monica	y 'know what ? after you 're with this woman for like ten minutes , you forget all that . i mean , she is this astounding person , with this , with this amazing spirit .
0121_126	ross	yeah , which she probably stole from some cheerleader .
0121_127	chandler	take off their hats
0121_128	phoebe	popes in a volkswagen i love that joke .

0121_130	rachel	no way . no way did you do this .
0121_131	fake monica	monana was very brave .
0121_132	monica	it was so wild . we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen . only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor
0121_133	fake monica	so once they caught on to the fact that we 're , y 'know , short and have breasts
0121_134	monica	they threw us out i was thrown out of a hotel me
0121_135	rachel	go monana well , you ladies are not the only ones living the dream . i get to go pour coffee for people i don 't know . don 't wait up .
0121_136	fake monica	oh , by the way , tomorrow we 're auditioning for a broadway show .
0121_137	monica	'scuse me ?
0121_138	fake monica	there 's an open call for cats . i 'm thinking we go down there , sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves . whaddya say ?
0121_139	monica	nononononono . think who you 're dealing with here . i mean , i 'm not like you . i-i can 't even stand in front of a tap class .
0121_140	fake monica	well , that 's just probably cause of your amish background .
0121_141	monica	what ?
0121_142	fake monica	well , you 're pennsylvania dutch , right ?
0121_143	monica	right . till i bought a blow dryer , then i was shunned .
0121_144	fake monica	i-i used to be just like you . and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life . did you ever see dead poets society ?
0121_145	monica	uh-huh .
0121_146	fake monica	i thought that movie was so incredibly boring . i mean , that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can 't be in the play ? what was that ? it 's like , kid , wait a year , leave home , do some community theatre . i walked out of there and i
0121_147	monica	wow . then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire .

0121_149	ross	oh god . we didn 't get into scranton . that was like our safety zoo . they take like dogs and cows . see ? i don 't know who this is harder on , me or him .
0121_150	phoebe	i 'd say that chair 's taking the brunt .
0121_151	ross	marcel marcel marcel , no good boy . see , how can nobody want him ?
0121_152	rachel	oh , somebody will .
0121_153	joey	you know there already is a joseph stalin ?
0121_154	chandler	you 're kidding .
0121_155	joey	apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people . you 'd think you would 've known that

0121_157	joey	phoebe . whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be ?
0121_158	phoebe	flame boy .

0121_160	ross	where exactly is your zoo ?
0121_161	dr. baldhara	well , it 's technically not a zoo per se , it 's more of an interactive wildlife experience . let me ask you some questions about , is it , uh , marcel ?
0121_162	ross	yes .
0121_163	dr. baldhara	does he , uh , fight with other animals ?
0121_164	ross	no-no , he 's , he 's very docile .

0121_166	ross	well i , i don 't know . why ?

0121_168	ross	he can hold a banana , if that 's whatcha mean
0121_169	dr. baldhara	how about a hammer , or a small blade ?
0121_170	ross	why- why- why would he need a blade ?
0121_171	dr. baldhara	well , if he 's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns , you 've got to give the little guy something . otherwise it 's just cruel .

0202_148	ross	i did not freak out .
0202_149	carol	why 'd you freak out ?

0202_152	susan	this should be fun .
0202_153	ross	no , no , carol . there 's nothing wrong with it . i just , i just don 't think breast milk is for adults .
0202_154	chandler	of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike .
0202_155	carol	ross , you 're being silly . i 've tried it , it 's no big deal . just taste it .
0202_156	ross	that would be no .

0202_167	chandler	howdy .
0202_168	joey	gimme a box a juice . well , they switched me over to hombre .
0202_169	chandler	well , maybe it 's because of the way you 're dressed .
0202_170	joey	or maybe it 's because this guy 's doing so good they wanna put more people on it . you should see this guy , chandler , he goes through two bottles a day .
0202_171	chandler	what do you care ? you 're an actor . this is your day job . this isn 't supposed to mean anything to you .
0202_172	joey	i know , but , i was the best , you know ? i liked being the best . i don 't know . maybe i should just get outta the game . they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .
0202_173	chandler	all right , say you do that . you know sooner or later somebody 's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar . and then where 're you gonna run ?
0202_174	joey	yeah i guess you 're right .

0202_184	rachel	yes .
0202_185	monica	it 's that terrible ?
0202_186	rachel	yes . monica , you don 't get it . it 's bad enough that she 's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with , but now , she 's actually , but now she 's actually stealing you .
0202_187	monica	me ? what are you talking about ? nobody could steal me from you . i mean , just because i 'm friends with her doesn 't make me any less friends with you . i mean , you 're my we 're , we 're oh , i love you .

0208_069	mnca	mmm-mmm .

0208_104	joey	ok , let 's start with the cons , cause they 're more fun . all right , rachel first .
0208_105	ross	i don 't know . i mean , all right , i guess you can say she 's a little spoiled sometimes .
0208_106	joey	you could say that .
0208_107	ross	and i guess , you know , sometimes , she 's a little ditzy , you know . and i 've seen her be a little too into her looks . oh , and julie and i , we have a lot in common cause we 're both paleontologists , but rachel 's just a waitress .

0208_225	rach	oh , well , that 's , that 's mighty big of you , ross . i said don 't go
0208_226	ross	you know what ? you know what ? if , things were the other way around , there 's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you .
0208_227	rach	well , then , i guess that 's the difference between us . see , i 'd never make a list .

0208_229	joey	i never know how long you 're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again , you know ? maybe a little longer .

0208_231	mnca	now , in some of these recipes , the quantities may seem just a little unusual , uh , like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars . i 've indicated four cups of coconut , and four cups of crushed nut , and only , uh , one tablespoon of mockolate .
0208_232	rtst	doesn 't matter .
0208_233	mnca	what ?
0208_234	rtst	our fda approval didn 't come through . something about laboratory rats .

0208_249	radio	the next one 's dedicated to rachel from ross . rachel , he wants you to know he 's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him .

0208_251	radio	uh , we 've just gotten a call from rachel , and she told us what ross did . it 's pretty appalling , and ross , if you 're listening , i don 't wanna play your song anymore . why don 't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance ? avery , michelle 's

0211_038	joey	hey , if she were marrying a guy , she 'd be like the worst lesbian ever .
0211_039	rachel	did i miss it ? did i miss it ?
0211_040	joey	no , i 'm on right after this guy shoots himself .
0211_041	chandler	whoa , she 's pretty .
0211_042	joey	yeah , and she 's really nice too . she taught me all about how to work the cameras , and smell-the-fart acting .
0211_043	rachel	i 'm sorry , what ?
0211_044	monica	what ?
0211_045	joey	it 's like , you got so many lines to learn so fast , that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one . so while you 're thinkin of it , you take this big pause where you look all intense , you know , like this .
0211_046	chandler	oh , ok .
0211_047	joey	there 's my scene , there 's my scene . mrs. wallace , i 'm dr. drake ramoray , your sister 's neurosurgeon .
0211_048	mrs. wallace	is she gonna be all right ?
0211_049	joey	i 'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected . your sister is suffering from a subcranial hematoma . perhaps we can discuss this over coffee .
0211_050	chandler	nice
0211_051	rachel	that 's great
0211_052	ross	excellent
0211_053	chandler	for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin to smell something .

0211_055	ross	that is so good do it again
0211_056	joey	all right , all right . damnit braverman , it 's right there on the chart
0211_057	chandler	that 's great . all right , i gotta get to work , i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect .
0211_058	ross	no no , that 's me .
0211_059	chandler	oh , yeah .
0211_060	ross	oh , hello .
0211_061	phoebe	oh , thanks . i couldn 't uh
0211_062	ross	is everything ok ?
0211_063	phoebe	um , no , huh-uh . one of my clients died on the massage table today .
0211_064	ross	oh my god .
0211_065	chandler	that 's a little more relaxed than you want them to get .
0211_066	phoebe	yeah , um , she was 82 years old . her name was um , mrs. adelman .
0211_067	monica	oh , honey .
0211_068	phoebe	yeah , it 's just so strange . i mean , she probably woke up today and thought , ok , i 'll have some breakfast , and then i 'll take a little walk , and then i 'll have my massage . little did she know god was thinking , ok , but that 's it . oh
0211_069	rachel	what do you mean ?
0211_070	phoebe	i think it went into me .

0211_073	monica	god , this is so hard . i can 't decide between lamb or duck .
0211_074	chandler	well , of course , lambs are scarier . otherwise the movie would 've been called silence of the ducks .
0211_075	rachel	ok , who ordered what ?
0211_076	ross	oh , i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim .
0211_077	chandler	yes , and this with the cigarette butt in it , is that decaf ?
0211_078	rachel	oh god .
0211_079	joey	i can 't believe you 're so uptight about your mom comin .
0211_080	rachel	i know , but it 's just it 's the first time , and i just don 't want her to think that because i didn 't marry barry , that my life is total crap , you know ?
0211_081	phoebe	talk about crap . try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time .
0211_082	joey	uh , pheebs , how long do you think this lady 'll be with us ?
0211_083	phoebe	i don 't know . i mean , she obviously has some kind of unfinished business . sit up
0211_084	mrs. green	there she is .
0211_085	rachel	mom
0211_086	mrs green	sweetie so this is where you work ? oh , it 's wonderful is it a living room ? is it a restaurant ? who can tell ? but i guess that 's the fun .
0211_087	rachel	pretty much .
0211_088	mrs green	monica you look gorgeous last time i saw you , it was eat or be eaten .
0211_089	rachel	this is joey , and phoebe , and this is chandler , and you remember ross .
0211_090	mrs green	oh hello , ross .
0211_091	ross	hi , mrs. green .
0211_092	mrs green	so , what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job ?
0211_093	rachel	oh mom
0211_094	mrs green	if you didn 't pour the coffee , no one would have anything to drink .
0211_095	chandler	believe me , sometimes that happens .
0211_096	mrs green	this is just so exciting . you know , i never worked . i went straight from my father 's house to the sorority house to my husband 's house . i am just so proud of you .
0211_097	rachel	really ?
0211_098	mrs green	yes .
0211_099	phoebe	i know who it is you remind me of . evelyn dermer . course , that 's before she got the lousy face lift . now she looks like soupy sales .
0211_100	joey	pheebs , who 's evelyn dermer ?
0211_101	phoebe	i don 't know . who 's soupy sales ?

0211_103	mrs green	oh my god , there 's an unattractive nude man playing the cello .
0211_104	rachel	yeah , well just be glad he 's not playing a smaller instrument .
0211_105	mrs green	you have some life here , sweetie .
0211_106	rachel	i know . and mom , i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn 't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything , but this is just so much better for me , you know ?
0211_107	mrs green	i do . you didn 't love barry . and i 've never seen you this happy . i look at you and i think , oh , this is what i want .
0211_108	rachel	for me .
0211_109	mrs green	well , not just for you .
0211_110	rachel	well , what do you mean ?
0211_111	mrs green	i 'm uh , considering leaving your father .
0211_112	monica	all right . tell me if this is too cute . lesbian wedding , chicken breasts .
0211_113	rachel	oh god . i think i 'm gonna be sick .
0211_114	monica	why ? it 's not like i 'm putting little nipples on them .
0211_115	ross	and you had no idea they weren 't getting along ?
0211_116	rachel	none .
0211_117	joey	they didn 't fight a lot ?
0211_118	rachel	no they didn 't even talk to each other . god , how was i supposed to know they were having problems ?
0211_119	phoebe	in my day , divorce was not an option .
0211_120	joey	hey , look who 's up .
0211_121	rachel	i just can 't believe this is happening . i mean , when i was little , everybody 's parents were getting divorced . i just figured as a grownup i wouldn 't have to worry about this .
0211_122	monica	is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering ? i mean , she 's doing it because she wants to be more like you .
0211_123	rachel	well , then , you know , couldn 't she have just copied my haircut ?
0211_124	chandler	you know , it 's funny when my parents got divorced , they sent me to this shrink , and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves . but in your case it 's actually kinda true .
0211_125	phoebe	that 's him .
0211_126	chandler	damn . my mail order grandfather hasn 't come yet .
0211_127	mr a	phoebe ?
0211_128	phoebe	yes , hi , mr. adelman . thanks for meeting me .
0211_129	mr a	oh , that 's all right , although you did cut into my busy day of sitting .
0211_130	phoebe	um , do you wanna sit ?
0211_131	mr a	oh , no , please , i spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up . now uh , what can i do for you , my dear ?
0211_132	phoebe	i don 't know how to say this , but i think when your wife 's spirit left her body , it um , kind of stuck around in me .
0211_133	mr a	you 're saying , my wife is in you ?
0211_134	phoebe	yeah . ok , you don 't have to believe me but um , can you think of any unfinished business she might have had , like any reason she 'd be hanging around ?
0211_135	mr a	well , i don 't know what to tell you dear . the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died , she wanted to see everything .
0211_136	phoebe	everything ?
0211_137	mr a	everything .
0211_138	phoebe	whoa , that 's a lot of stuff .
0211_139	mr a	oh , wait , i remember , she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time .
0211_140	phoebe	i 'm sorry , there 's laughing in my head .
0211_141	mr a	worth a shot , huh ?

0211_143	mrs green	look at this .
0211_144	rachel	these are from halloween three years ago .
0211_145	mrs green	oh , look , here 's barry . did he have to come straight from the office ?
0211_146	rachel	no , that was his costume . see , he 's actually an orthodontist , but he came as a regular dentist .
0211_147	monica	um , you guys , you know when i said before , thank you , but i don 't really need your help ?
0211_148	rachel	actually , what i think you said was , don 't touch that , and get the hell out of my kitchen .
0211_149	monica	really ? weird . anyway , see , i planned everything really well . i planned and i planned and i planned . it just turns out , i don 't think i planned enough time to actually do it .
0211_150	rachel	hey , mon , you want some help ?
0211_151	monica	if you want .
0211_152	phoebe	hey . what a day . i took her everywhere . the museum of modern art , rockefeller center , statue of liberty .
0211_153	rachel	she 's still with you ?
0211_154	phoebe	yeah . i guess she hasn 't seen everything yet . i 'll be right back , she has to go to the bathroom again . oh , such a pretty face .
0211_155	mrs green	this is so much fun , just the girls . you know what we should do ? does anybody have any marijuana ?
0211_156	rachel	god
0211_157	monica	all right , look , nobody 's smoking pot around all this food .
0211_158	mrs green	that 's fine . i never did it . i just thought i might . so , what 's new in sex ?
0211_159	rachel	oh what 's new in sex ?
0211_160	mrs green	the only man i 've ever been with is your father .
0211_161	monica	i 'm dicing , i 'm dicing , i don 't hear anything .
0211_162	mrs green	i mean , this is no offense to your dad , sweetie , but i was thinking there might be more .
0211_163	rachel	oh , i 'm sorry . you know what ? i cannot have this conversation with you . i mean , god , you just come in here , and drop this bomb on me , before you even tell daddy . what ? what do you want ? do you want my blessing ?
0211_164	mrs green	no .
0211_165	rachel	you want me to talk you out of it ?
0211_166	mrs green	no .
0211_167	rachel	then what ? what do you want ?
0211_168	mrs green	i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this .
0211_169	rachel	why on earth would i understand this ?
0211_170	mrs green	you didn 't marry your barry . i did .
0211_171	rachel	oh .

0211_175	joey	i 'm sorry , it 's the pigs. they 're reluctant to get in the blankets
0211_176	phoebe	monica , how did this happen ? i thought you had this all planned out .
0211_177	monica	do you want me to cry ? is that what you want ? do you wanna see me cry ?

0212-0213_007	ross	that commercial always makes me so sad .
0212-0213_008	joey	yeah , but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him , so , everything seems to work out ok .
0212-0213_009	ross	i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel .
0212-0213_010	phoebe	i can see that , cause they both have those big brown eyes and , ya know , the little pouty chin . monica and the fact that they 're both monkeys .
0212-0213_011	ross	sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing , ya know , giving him away .
0212-0213_012	rachel	oh , ross , you had to , i mean , he was humping everything in sight . i mean , i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding .
0212-0213_013	ross	remember when sometimes he 'd borrow your hat , and , and when you got it back there 'd be little monkey raisins in it .
0212-0213_014	chandler	yeah , well sure , when he did it , it was funny . when i did it to my boss 's hat . . . all of the sudden i have this big attitude problem .

0220_301	ernie	bert , bert . bert . hey , what happened to my friend bert ? he was here just a moment ago . oh no , my old friend bert is lost .

0222_002	monica	so , i 'll get candles and my mom 's lace tablecloth , and since it 's rachel 's birthday , i mean , we want it to be special , i thought i 'd poach a salmon .
0222_003	all	ohhh .
0222_004	monica	what ?
0222_005	ross	question . why do we always have to have parties where you poach things ?
0222_006	monica	you wanna be in charge of the food committee ?
0222_007	ross	question two . why do we always have to have parties with committees ?
0222_008	joey	really . why can 't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun ?
0222_009	ross	yeah .
0222_010	phoebe	yeah , i agree . ya know , i think fancy parties are only fun if you 're fancy on the inside and i 'm just not sure we are .
0222_011	monica	alright . if you guys don 't want it to be special , fine . you can throw any kind of party you want .

0222_013	monica	joey they 're not real . i start miles beneath the surface of these things , ok , they 're fake . see honk honk .
0222_014	chandler	wow , it 's , it 's like porno for clowns .

0222_017	ross	i talked to rachel 's sisters , neither of them can come .
0222_018	monica	ok , um so , i still have to invite dillon and emma and shannon cooper .
0222_019	joey	woah , woah , woah , uh , no shannon cooper .
0222_020	phoebe	why not her ?
0222_021	joey	cause she uh , she steals stuff .
0222_022	chandler	or maybe she doesn 't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back .
0222_023	monica	joey that is horriable .
0222_024	joey	hey i liked her , alright . maybe , maybe too much . i don 't know i guess i just got scared .
0222_025	phoebe	i 'm sorry , i didn 't know .
0222_026	joey	i didn 't think anyone 'd buy that , ok .

0222_028	ross	hi honey , how did it go ?
0222_029	rachel	agh , it was the graduation from hell .
0222_030	chandler	ya know , my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship .
0222_031	rachel	ya know , i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion . my sister 's graduating from college , nobody thought she would . it 's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica .
0222_032	monica	so what happened ?
0222_033	rachel	my parents happened . all they had to do was sit in the same stadium , smile proudly , and not talk about the divorce . but nooo , they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address . bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them . but you know what , you know
0222_034	phoebe	ok , so i guess we don 't invite her parents .
0222_035	monica	well , how bout just her mom ?
0222_036	chandler	why her mom ?
0222_037	monica	cause i already invited her .
0222_038	phoebe	ooh , ooh , did you ask stacy roth ?
0222_039	joey	oh no , can 't invite her . she also steals .

0223_047	richard	you 're pretty much running that risk either way .

0223_051	richard	oh , alright .

0304_052	susan	so he 's got a doll ? so what ? unless you 're afraid he 's gonna grow up and be in show business .
0304_053	carol	this doesn 't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women , does it ?

0304_079	chandler	do we have any do we have any thoughts here ?
0304_080	joey	well , i 've never been through the tunnel myself , cause as i understand it , you 're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right . but , it seems to me it 's pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear . it have a fear
0304_081	rachel	amazingly , that makes sense .
0304_082	chandler	you think ?

0304_123	rachel and monica	uff .

0310_043	rachel	huh . well , y 'know that  s actually a really good idea , because that way they  ll be closer to the mugs . y 'know what , you should have the other waitresses do that too .
0310_044	gunther	they already do . that  s why they call it the  tray spot . 
0310_045	rachel	gee , i always heard them talk about that , i just always thought that it was a club they went to . oh god , i  m , i  m sorry .
0310_046	gunther	it  s all right . sweetheart .

0310_048	ross	so , this must be kinda neat for ya , huh ? i mean , your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school , and you , you ah , don  t have to sell those cookies anymore .
0310_049	sarah	well , i kinda wanted to sell the cookies . the girl who sells the most wins a trip to spacecamp , and gets to sit in a real space shuttle .
0310_050	ross	wow , you ah , you really like all this space stuff , huh ?
0310_051	sarah	yeah . my dad says if i spend as much time helping him clean apartments , as i do daydreaming about outer space , he  d be able to afford a trip to the taj mahal .
0310_052	ross	i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india .
0310_053	sarah	no . the one in atlantic city , dad loves the slots . he says he  s gonna double the college money my grandma left me .
0310_054	ross	huh . well , good luck to dad . say , how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win ?

0310_059	sarah	five dollars a box .
0310_060	ross	and what is second prize ?
0310_061	sarah	a ten speed bike . but , i  d rather have something my dad couldn  t sell .

0310_063	sarah	could you do me one favor , if it  s not too much trouble ?
0310_064	ross	yeah , sarah , anything .
0310_065	sarah	could you pull open the curtains for me ? the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news , and since we don  t have a tv , the lady across the alley said she  d push hers up to a window , so i could watch it .

0316_099	chandler	well , before we answer that , i think we should address the more important question . how dumb are you ?
0316_100	ross	what ? look , we  re trying to rebuild a relationship here , right . how am i supposed to do that here , without being totally honest with each other ?
0316_101	joey	look , ross look , i  m on board about this totally honesty thing , i am , just not about stuff that  s gonna get you in trouble .
0316_102	chandler	he  s right . nobody  s gonna benefit , and you  re just gonna hurt her .
0316_103	joey	yeah , and there won  t be a relationship left to rebuild .
0316_104	ross	yeah , but don  t you think
0316_105	chandler	all right look , if you absolutely have to tell her , at least wait until the timing  s right . and that  s what deathbeds are for .
0316_106	ross	yeah , okay .
0316_107	joey	all right , okay , now , we just have to make sure she doesn  t find out some other way . did you think about the trail ?
0316_108	ross	what trail ?
0316_109	joey	the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it you always have to think about the trail
0316_110	ross	oh , i-i don  t think there  s any trail .

0316_119	phoebe	huh , well , the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don  t seem to think it  s that bad .
0316_120	monica	that  s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid . but hey , y 'know if you don  t believe me , please , by my guest .

0408_021	ross	should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office ?
0408_022	rachel	you shouldnt .
0408_023	phoebe	speaking of christmas , umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money , umm , this year maybe we could do secret santa , and then we each only buy one gift . and-and theres the added mystery of who gets who .

0423_153	emily	she said , if i  m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day , well then we should just postpone it .
0423_154	ross	postpone it ? emily , do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ? do you my sister  s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here , huh ? this isn  t right .
0423_155	emily	i realize that people are going to be disappointed . but , i  m sure they  ll come back when we can do it right .
0423_156	ross	i can  t ask people to do that ? would you ask people to do that ?

0516_184	rachel	thanks
0516_185	joey	uh , hey , rach let me ask you something . uh , i was just over there talking to monica and chandler , boy they are really tight .
0516_186	rachel	i know .
0516_187	joey	yeah that 's not such a bad situation they got going over there . i 'm thinking of getting me one of those .
0516_188	rachel	what 's up joe ?
0516_189	joey	well , the reason i think monica and chandler are so great
0516_190	rachel	yeah ?
0516_191	joey	is because they were friends first . y 'know ? so i asked myself , who are my friends ? you and phoebe , and i saw you first . so
0516_192	rachel	what are you saying ?
0516_193	joey	i 'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .
0516_194	rachel	y 'know honey , umm , as uh , as flattered as i am that uh , you saw me first , uhh , i just , i-i don 't think we should be cranking anything up .
0516_195	joey	i 'll treat you real nice .
0516_196	rachel	yeah , well , y 'know umm no honey , listen i think it 's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them , but i think the way you do it is y 'know you meet someone , become their friend , build a foundation , then you ask them out on a date .
0516_197	joey	won 't-won 't that take longer ?
0516_198	rachel	yeah . yeah . oh , but once you find it , ohh it 's so worth the wait .

0520_243	rachel	because a car backfired ?
0520_244	ross	okay , why are you here ?
0520_245	rachel	well , i-i-i don 't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um , emily called you today .
0520_246	ross	you talked to her ?
0520_247	rachel	no , she left a message . but it-it kinda got erased . there 's just something wrong with your machine .
0520_248	ross	well , okay , what-what did she say ?
0520_249	rachel	well , uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh , she wants you to call her .
0520_250	ross	wow
0520_251	rachel	now , that-that was a good thing that i told you , right ?
0520_252	ross	huh ? yeah yes , of course
0520_253	rachel	okay . thank you thank you becausei 'm sorry , all right . because y 'know what ? she didn 't want menot important . the point is , i was right . your decision . okay ? i was right . your decision .
0520_254	ross	right . i guess , i guess i should call emily .
0520_255	rachel	okay , no , that 's not the right decision . that 's not , that 's not right , no ross-ross , come on i mean , that woman made you miserable okay , ross , do you really want to get back into that ?
0520_256	ross	okay , look , yesterday i would 've even considered calling her back , but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience . i mean , that-that has got to mean something
0520_257	rachel	ugh , ross that was not a near death experience that was barely an experience
0520_258	ross	you weren 't there okay , maybe this is something that i-i 'm supposed to seize y 'know ?
0520_259	rachel	okay , y 'know what ? maybe , this is not about seizing stuff . maybe this is about escaping stuff .
0520_260	ross	huh .
0520_261	rachel	i mean , look-look today you escaped death , y 'know ? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?
0520_262	ross	that does make sense . because i do wanna seize some opportunity , but i-i really don 't wanna see or talk to her .
0520_263	rachel	well , there you go
0520_264	ross	yeah . maybe today is just , close call day .
0520_265	rachel	close call day .

0520_281	phoebe	yes . once . yeah , a little . he kinda did it to himself . it 's not really a good story .
0520_282	ross	i wonder how i would react under fire , y 'know ? and not backfire but-but heavy fire , like i was in a war or something .
0520_283	monica	man , i would be great in a war i mean , i really , i think i would make a fantastic military leader . i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .
0520_284	chandler	before or after you were shot by your own troops ?
0520_285	ross	i know where joey would be . he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .
0520_286	chandler	yes , if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .
0520_287	joey	yeah , hero sandwiches .
0520_288	phoebe	well you all know that i 'm a pacifist so i 'm not interested in war in any way . but y 'know what ? when the revolution comes , i will have to destroy you all . not you joey .

0521_077	ross	free cats do that too , y 'know . which reminds me , if i might get a little political here , support your local animal shelter . pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from , you get a much better deal from the shelter , plus they probably won 't die on you in

0603_033	ross	i am not in love with her . she was very upset about having to move out so i eh , didnt tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset . i-i just comforted her , as a friend .
0603_034	phoebe	what do you mean , comforted her ?
0603_035	ross	its nothing , i just gave her a hug .
0603_036	phoebe	ah-ha a classic sign of love , the hug
0603_037	ross	its also a sign of friendship .
0603_038	phoebe	yeah , not in your case lovey loverson .
0603_039	ross	it was a hug
0603_040	phoebe	okay , just tell me this , did you or did you not smell her hair ?
0603_041	ross	s-s-smell her hair ? what if i did ?
0603_042	phoebe	ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head thats why , thats why women are shorter . so that men will fall in love when they hug them oh come on ross , youre a scientist .
0603_043	ross	i was hugging her as a friend . its not my fault her-her hair got in my face , shes got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty . what ? oh , that doesnt mean i have feelings for rachel maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts
0603_044	phoebe	okay , whatever you say . but just be careful , all right ? rachels not in the same place you are .
0603_045	ross	if the place you are referring too is being in love , then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place
0603_046	phoebe	okay , i didnt understand that , but yknow , maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love

0603_055	chandler	well , i like that idea . obviously i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room , yknow ? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like space invaders and asteroids for $ 200 , the real ones the big-big ones
0603_056	monica	no .
0603_057	chandler	okay so you mean no as in , gee chandler , what an interesting idea . lets discuss it before we reject it completely .

0605_121	chandler	check it out check it out when the babies wake up , they can meet krog
0605_122	monica	chandler , what are you doing ? that thing can put someones eye out
0605_123	chandler	he can do more than that he can destroy the universe
0605_124	phoebe	no chandler , they can swallow one of those little parts and also , look at his smooth area , thats just gonna mess them up .
0605_125	chandler	theyre not gonna swallow anything , you guys are being way over protective . when i was a kid , my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
0605_126	phoebe	what ?
0605_127	chandler	glass , sand , whatever .
0605_128	phoebe	oh , look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .
0605_129	monica	oh its so cute . i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .
0605_130	phoebe	oh , i can still do that .
0605_131	monica	how are you still single ?
0605_132	chandler	all right . i thought about it and maybe youre right . maybe krog is not a safe toy .
0605_133	monica	good . what made you change your mind ?
0605_134	chandler	i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .
0605_135	phoebe	how did that happen ?
0605_136	chandler	well , i was trying to prove that i was right . yknow ? and it turns out i was wrong . and now its lodged in my throat .
0605_137	monica	damnit yknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and , and no one was watching chandler

0605_139	judge	okay you two are asking the court for an annulment ?
0605_140	rachel	yes your honor , and here are , are forms , all filled out .
0605_141	judge	so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable .
0605_142	ross	fine , im mentally unstable .
0605_143	judge	and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user .
0605_144	ross	what ?
0605_145	rachel	uh yes , heroin and crack .
0605_146	ross	crack isnt even an intravenous drug
0605_147	rachel	well , you would know .
0605_148	judge	now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?
0605_149	ross	oh , come on
0605_150	rachel	ross , please , i found the magazines
0605_151	judge	and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage . well , that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .
0605_152	ross	okay , im sorry , this is insane i-i-im not addicted to heroin , im not gay , and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything look , ill consummate this marriage right here , right now
0605_153	judge	that wont be necessary .
0605_154	ross	and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
0605_155	rachel	ugh
0605_156	judge	now if you were two involved in a serious relationship , that really creates a problem .
0605_157	rachel	ross your honor , rest assured relationship ended like two years ago and could you strike consummated like bunnies from the record ?
0605_158	judge	is there , anything in this record that is actually true ?
0605_159	rachel	well , yes , we got married in vegas and uh , and the names i think .
0605_160	judge	well , based on what i heard , you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment . if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .
0605_161	ross	thats great are you happy now ? look what you did with your funny , funny form
0605_162	rachel	what ? me ? what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense
0605_163	ross	and what what are you typing that for ? did you hear what she said ? we dont get the annulment . dont type that what ? stop typing hey stop typing stop typing stop typing
0605_164	rachel	okay , do you see , do you see what youre keeping me married too ?
0605_165	judge	you need to get out of my chambers .
0605_166	rachel	all right look lady here is the deal , i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one
0605_167	ross	yeah

0605_174	joey	no . no , i just uh , i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .
0605_175	monica	and people will think you own a porsche because youre wearing the clothes ?
0605_176	joey	of course only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car right ?
0605_177	chandler	that is true .
0605_178	phoebe	yeah , but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .
0605_179	joey	oh , ive been there . yeah , i am gonna go drive my porsche .

0605_181	joey	come on what are you doing ? im in character would you talk to her

0608_178	kim	listen to me . if you think sleeping with ralph is going to get you my job . you are sadly mistaken .

0609_018	chandler	what ? what ? why ?
0609_019	monica	maybe because you used to be aloof , or that you  re really sarcastic , or that , y  know , you joke around all the time . or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .
0609_020	chandler	is this why they don  t like me or why you don  t like me ?
0609_021	monica	look , i know that i should  ve told them . i know i shouldn  t care what they think . i  m sorry .

0609_186	monica	ross , i can  t believe you  d do that
0609_187	chandler	the reason we haven  t told them we  re together is because they hate me , okay ? so will you fix this ?

0612_224	monica	okay , chandler , you go first .
0612_225	chandler	okay , i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .
0612_226	monica	oh , wait , is he the guy i met at christmas ?
0612_227	chandler	can i finish my story ?
0612_228	monica	do you want me to pick you ?
0612_229	ross	see , i would never snap at you like that .

0612_231	monica	continue .
0612_232	chandler	so steve said he had to go to the doctor . and steves doctors name is doctor muppy . so i said , doctor monkey ? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .

0612_234	chandler	im not arguing with that .

0612_237	monica	you are both idiots . the joke is not funny , and its offensive to women , and doctors , and monkeys you shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit , you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world now let it go the joke sucks

0612_239	ross	its your joke .
0612_240	chandler	is not .

0612_242	monica	hi , chandler . there you are .
0612_243	chandler	hi , oh hi .
0612_244	monica	hey , its phoebe and rachel . um , why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?

0612_246	chandler	monica is a self-sufficient , together lady . being with her has been like being on a vacation . and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit .
0612_247	rachel	wow , you know what ? that is the best fake speech i think ive ever heard .
0612_248	phoebe	really ? ive heard better .
0612_249	monica	wait , wait , he came up with that himself . tell them , chandler .
0612_250	chandler	im out of words . should i just say the whole thing again ?
0612_251	monica	look , i am not high maintenance . i am not . chandler
0612_252	chandler	youre a little high maintenance .
0612_253	monica	ahhh you are on my list .
0612_254	chandler	im sorry . youre not easy-going , but youre passionate , and thats good . and when you get upset about the little things , i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that . and thats good too . so , they can say that youre high maintenance , but its okay , because i
0612_255	monica	i didnt even tell him to say that . . all right youre off my list .
0612_256	chandler	im off the list .
0612_257	monica	phoebe , its okay that you dont want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .
0612_258	phoebe	yknow , suddenly i find you very attractive .

0612_260	chandler	hey , buddy boy , howd the audition go ?
0612_261	joey	not good , no . i didnt get the part , and i lost my job here , so

0615-0616_010	joey	ohh-oh , wasnt he cheating on you with her ?
0615-0616_011	rachel	yeah , but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .
0615-0616_012	monica	why did they get divorced ?
0615-0616_013	rachel	well , apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else . isnt that sad ? god , could you imagine if i actually married him ? i mean how different would my life be ?
0615-0616_014	ross	i know what you mean , ive always wondered how different my life would be if-if id never gotten divorced .
0615-0616_015	phoebe	which time ?
0615-0616_016	ross	the first time no seriously , imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian .
0615-0616_017	joey	i cant . i keep seeing it the good way .
0615-0616_018	ross	id bet id still be doing my kara-tay . towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow , not doing anything else physical .
0615-0616_019	chandler	maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay .
0615-0616_020	monica	and what if i was still fat ? well , you wouldnt be dating me , thats for sure .
0615-0616_021	chandler	sure i would

0615-0616_031	rachel	well why didnt you take the job ?
0615-0616_032	phoebe	because at that time you see , i thought everything that rhymed was true . so i thought yknow that if id work with stocks , id have to live in a box , and only eat lox , and have a pet fox .
0615-0616_033	ross	hey , do you guys think that if all those things happened , wed still hang out ?
0615-0616_035	<error>	transcribers note this is where the opening credits are , but theyre not the usual opening credits . oh no these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened . it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and

0702_126	monica	i dont believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house
0702_127	mrs. geller	were sorry honey , but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself .
0702_128	monica	you bought the beach house when i was 23
0702_129	mr. geller	which means you had seven years of beach fun and you cant put a price on that sweetie .
0702_130	mrs. geller	we really do feel bad about this though .
0702_131	mr. geller	we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell , so we redid the kitchen .

0702_133	mrs. geller	well it was chandler we didnt think hed ever propose
0702_134	chandler	clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .
0702_135	monica	i cant believe it that there is no money for my wedding ?
0702_136	mrs. geller	we might still have some money , if your father didnt think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet .
0702_137	mr. geller	it seemed like such a simple idea .

0708_005	ross	what , are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?
0708_006	chandler	no , we 're playing this game i learned at work . you have to name all the states in six minutes .
0708_007	ross	what ? that 's like insanely easy
0708_008	chandler	now , that 's a lot harder than it sounds . you always forget at least one , or in some cases fourteen .
0708_009	monica	it 's a stupid game and i wasn 't playing against other people , so technically i didn 't lose .
0708_010	ross	what ? you forgot fourteen states ?
0708_011	monica	nobody cares about the dakotas .

0708_013	chandler	oh , okay , time 's up
0708_014	rachel	all right , i got 48 .
0708_015	chandler	oh that 's not bad , pheebs ?
0708_016	phoebe	oh , i got tired of naming states . so i decided to list the types of celery , and i have one regular celery .
0708_017	chandler	okay , so rachel 's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables , joey ?
0708_018	joey	say hello to the new champ of chandler 's dumb states game .
0708_019	ross	wow , how many have you got ?
0708_020	joey	fifty-six

0708_023	joey	hey how is new england not a state ? huh ? they have a sports-team
0708_024	chandler	does south oregon have a sports-team ? there you go .

0708_026	rachel	how come we have one extra place setting ?
0708_027	monica	'cause you invited your assistant .
0708_028	rachel	oh , right . sorry . but tag 's not coming his girlfriend came into town , so he 's spending thanksgiving with her .
0708_029	monica	oh why didn 't you tell me ? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .
0708_030	rachel	well , i was going to , but then i figured , you know you 're food is so delicious and perfect , you can never have too many of those pumpkin things .
0708_031	monica	now you think i wouldn 't enjoy that , because it is so fake , but i still do .
0708_032	phoebe	regular celery oh , i already have that .
0708_033	ross	done with time a-to-spare .
0708_034	chandler	oooh that may be a new world 's record
0708_035	ross	you know , i hate to lecture you guys , but it 's kinda disgraceful , that a group of well-educated adults and joey can 't name all the states . did you ever see a map , or one of those round , colorful things called a globe ? hmm ?
0708_036	chandler	uh , magellan ? you got 46 states .
0708_037	ross	what ? that 's impossible .
0708_038	joey	46 . wow who 's well educated now , mr. i-forgot-ten-states ?
0708_039	monica	all right , i 'm out of oven space . i 'm gonna turn on joey 's . please , watch him do not let joey eat any of the food
0708_040	chandler	i am only one man okay ross , time is up
0708_041	ross	no , just give me another minute .
0708_042	chandler	look ross , if you don 't know them by now , you will never know them , okay ? that is the beauty of this game . it makes you want to kill yourself .
0708_043	ross	this-this is crazy i can do this all right , uhh , i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .
0708_044	chandler	okay , but if you can 'tno dinner
0708_045	ross	you 're on
0708_046	joey	all right . don 't look at my list , ross , cause there 's a lot on there that you don 't have .
0708_047	monica	hey , did you guys know , that your oven doesn 't work ?
0708_048	joey	but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay , right ?
0708_049	monica	ross , i 'm gonna use yours , okay ?
0708_050	ross	pshhshhh
0708_051	monica	chandler ? can you give me a hand ?
0708_052	chandler	sure , and joey do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .
0708_053	joey	don 't worry , chandler , it 's not a globe of the united states .

0708_055	phoebe	hey you guys i 'm gonna go out and take a walk .

0708_060	phoebe	it 's just my knitting that 's all yes i knit this . i 'm very good .

0708_062	monica	rosss apartment is nice how come we don 't hang out here more often ?
0708_063	chandler	i don 't know . maybe it 's because it smells a little weird . it 's like old pumpkins or something .
0708_064	monica	that 's my pie
0708_065	chandler	which smells delicious
0708_066	monica	uh-oh uh-oh
0708_067	chandler	what ?

0708_099	chandler	extremely allergic , okay ? if i 'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes , my throat will just close up
0708_100	phoebe	that 's odd , cause this dog 's been living here for the past 3 days
0708_101	chandler	really ?
0708_102	monica	chandler , if that dog 's been here that long , and you haven 't had a reaction , maybe you 're not allergic to this dog ?
0708_103	chandler	well , it still has to go , right ?
0708_104	monica and phoebe	why ?
0708_105	chandler	okay , it 's um

0708_110	phoebe	are you crazy ?
0708_111	ross	are you out of your mind ?
0708_112	phoebe	why ?
0708_113	joey	told ya .
0708_114	chandler	they are needy , they are jumpy , and you can 't tell what they are thinking , and that scares me a little bit .
0708_115	ross	right , they are scary . ahh , she just ate a treat out of my hand
0708_116	rachel	wait a minute . do you not like all dogs ? i mean , not even puppies ?
0708_117	chandler	is there a puppy here ?

0708_119	chandler	okay , you are new
0708_120	joey	look , chandler , i told you , never tell anyone about this dog thing . it 's like ross not likin ice cream .
0708_121	phoebe	you don 't like ice cream ?
0708_122	ross	it 's too cold .
0708_123	chandler	okay , it 's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .
0708_124	ross	it hurts my teeth .
0708_125	chandler	and i don 't wanna say this , i don 't you guys to hate me , but uh , i don 't think , i can be around that dog anymore . okay , so either the dog goes , or i go . oh my god

0708_131	rachel	oh , wait before you guys go , can i just ask you a question ?
0708_132	monica	yeah .
0708_133	rachel	when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend , what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?
0708_134	phoebe	oh , i 'd say about a month .
0708_135	monica	really ? i 'd say 3 to 4 .
0708_136	joey	half hour .
0708_137	rachel	interesting .
0708_138	monica	when it 's your assistant , i would say never .
0708_139	joey	all right , rach , the big question is , does he like you ? all right ? because if he doesn 't like you , this is all a moo-point .
0708_140	rachel	huh . a moo-point ?
0708_141	joey	yeah , it 's like a cow 's opinion . it just doesn 't matter . it 's moo .
0708_142	rachel	have i been living with him for too long , or did that all just make sense ?
0708_143	monica	please , don 't listen to joey , okay . would you look at him ? he-hes obviously depressed . he 's away from his family he 's spending thanksgiving with strangers . what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .
0708_144	rachel	you 're right , i 'm sorry . thank you . okay , that 's what i 'm gonna do .
0708_145	joey	fine take their advice . no one ever listens to me . when the package is this pretty , no one cares what 's inside .

0713_238	rachel	hey chandler
0713_239	chandler	hey
0713_240	rachel	how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines , has a rolling massage , and speakers in the head rest ?
0713_241	chandler	yeah , id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore .
0713_242	rachel	well what if i told you , you can do it in my apartment ?
0713_243	chandler	are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete ? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year ?
0713_244	rachel	i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000 .
0713_245	chandler	thats awesome thats great what made you do it ?
0713_246	rachel	well , its a long story , but umm i broke joeys chair
0713_247	chandler	whoa-whoa-whoa you broke joeys chair ?
0713_248	rachel	yeah .
0713_249	chandler	i thought i broke joeys chair thats why i replaced it with mine
0713_250	rachel	ohhhhh . thats how it got fixed
0713_251	chandler	well , what did you think , that-that elves came in and fixed it ?
0713_252	rachel	noo angels .
0713_253	chandler	im gettin my chair back
0713_254	rachel	what ? wh-hey

0713_256	joey	well , it looks like it wasnt heeled after all yeah so , i guess this chair is mine now
0713_257	chandler	joey you broke my chair
0713_258	joey	your chair ?
0713_259	rachel	yeah , he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
0713_260	joey	so , there was no miracle ?
0713_261	rachel	no joe , no miracle .
0713_262	joey	oh no this is devastating my faith is shaken . im so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life .
0713_263	rachel	uh-huh nice try , but you dont get that chair anymore all right ? that is my chair now you can sit on my lap no i take that back
0713_264	chandler	i think i should get the chair

0713_266	joey	how do you figure ?
0713_267	chandler	because you broke a chair and you broke a chair the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair , is me
0713_268	rachel	no-no-no this chairs not going anywhere .
0713_269	chandler	well , wheres the logic in that ?
0713_270	rachel	the logic is , that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half
0713_271	chandler	so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing

0713_273	joey	thats right
0713_274	chandler	what are you guys ? like a gang or something ?

0713_296	earl	couldnt it just be a coincidence ?
0713_297	phoebe	no , its fate

0714_194	rachel	so , if i wanna have my kid when im 35 , i dont have to get pregnant until im 34 . which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes oh wait , but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant
0714_195	monica	really that long ? look all you want , its happening
0714_196	rachel	no , so i dont have to get married until im 33 thats three years , thats three whole yearsoh , wait a minute though . ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding , and id like to know the guy for a year , year and a half before we get engaged which means i

0715_182	joey	uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i , that i came up to you before was because well , im really nervous about-about being you . yknow if you can help me capture the essence of the character . yknow ? help me keep jessica alive . please ?
0715_183	cecilia	all right joey , i will help you . not because i-i owe it to this stupid show , but because i owe it to jessica .

0715_185	cecilia	youre so welcome .
0715_186	joey	hey now , ive been watching some tapes , hows this ? jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again ever
0715_187	cecilia	is that supposed to be me ?
0715_188	joey	yeah .
0715_189	cecilia	yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent .
0715_190	joey	i can do an english accent ? that babys going on my resume

0715_192	chandler	well , i feel like a snack
0715_193	monica	do you want some shortbread ? eh thats scottish like you are .
0715_194	chandler	oh no thanks . i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage .
0715_195	ross	what ?
0715_196	chandler	well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings . anyway , lots of bad memories .
0715_197	ross	oh well , it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh , rediscover its scottish roots .
0715_198	monica	no no-no theyre not . theyre still very angry but yknow chandler is also half-swedish . you know what the swedish people are famous for ? sitting down and being quiet .
0715_199	ross	well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more
0715_200	monica	you can not play bagpipes at the wedding
0715_201	ross	how did you know about that ?
0715_202	chandler	we heard you play all the way from your apartment
0715_203	ross	were you the ones called the cops ?
0715_204	chandler	thats not really important right now . what is important is while we appreciate the gesture , we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .
0715_205	ross	why not ?
0715_206	chandler	because we hate them .
0715_207	ross	come on thats not fair i mean you havent even heard me play
0715_208	chandler	we have heard you play .
0715_209	ross	no , youve heard my practice . okay ? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want . and im not going to tell you what song im gonna play either . but uh , lets just say when its over ill bet there will be a we bit o celebration .

0715_211	cecilia	so , the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence . so , when jessica enters a room for instance , she owns everything and every person in that room . you try .
0715_212	joey	okay all right
0715_213	cecilia	no , he already knows that he owns everything in the room hes not finding it out for the first time so , try it again .
0715_214	joey	okay . okay .
0715_215	cecilia	right . hes not angry at the room either . try it again , he owns it he owns the room . it is his . he owns , owns , owns , owns the room he owns it all right , its a little weird , but its getting better . oh well , im gonna miss this woman
0715_216	joey	oh wellhey-hey maybe , maybe uh , maybe this is a good thing . yknow ? itll-itll give you a chance to shake things up , play different characters . youre so talented .
0715_217	cecilia	i am . i am , but i dont know you know . an actor of a certain age is not that easy .
0715_218	joey	hey thats not true look at uh , look at angela lansbangelina jolie
0715_219	cecilia	i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in , but yknow i just got so comfy here and ohh , i turned down some amazing work
0715_220	joey	like-like what ?
0715_221	cecilia	well , lets just say if i left 15 years ago , the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
0715_222	joey	wow
0715_223	cecilia	but well now , nows a different time for me .
0715_224	joey	oh hey come on , dont-dont-dont do this umm , look let-let me tell you something , okay ? now when i watch you do a scene , im thinking , boy , she-she is a great actress uh but-but , i am also thinking , she is hot
0715_225	cecilia	you think im hot ?
0715_226	joey	you own the room . we should probably get-get uh
0715_227	cecilia	oh yeah-yeah , we should get the so when jessica kisses a man , she usually puts umm , both her hands on the mans face .
0715_228	joey	yeah-yeah , i noticed that is that cause shes so passionate ?
0715_229	cecilia	no its because that way the camera only sees her do you wanna try it ?
0715_230	joey	yeah okay .
0715_231	cecilia	that was good , that was really good . but i-i think your hands maybe a little off , they should be maybe right like

0719_115	joey	hey , im back
0719_116	the casting director	hi-hi joey .
0719_117	joey	uh so , will-will i be reading the same scene again ?
0719_118	the casting director	actually , i tried to call to you . you didnt need to come down here today .
0719_119	joey	oh great yknow i wouldve been perfect for this part , but whatever yknow , thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie good day
0719_120	the casting director	wait joey you didnt need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it .
0719_121	joey	and scene huh ? wasnt that fun ? we did a little improv there . yeah okay so you-you-you-you were saying ?
0719_122	the casting director	well , the director thinks youre really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow .
0719_123	joey	wow sure thats great
0719_124	the casting director	oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity .
0719_125	joey	yeah yeah sure , just long as its handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .
0719_126	the casting director	terrific well uh , theres one more thing . uhh , uh its really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic . yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how shes never seen a naked man who wasnt jewish . so
0719_127	joey	sowhat ?
0719_128	the casting director	so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically , anatomically not jewish . do you know what im saying ?
0719_129	joey	yes
0719_130	the casting director	okay .
0719_131	joey	no . what ?
0719_132	the casting director	an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be
0719_133	joey	barmifsaed ?

0719_136	monica	so to get this part you cant be ?
0719_137	joey	nope .
0719_138	monica	but you are ?

0719_140	monica	but you told them you werent ?
0719_141	joey	thats right .
0719_142	monica	wow wow and its definitely all gone ? theres nothing there to work with ? what were you thinking ?
0719_143	joey	i dont know i really want this part and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes . like if-if they want you to ride a horse , you tell em you can and just figure out how to do it later .
0719_144	monica	joey this is not like learning to ride a horse this is like learning togrow a turtleneck
0719_145	joey	i kn-i know i know okay ? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .
0719_146	monica	oh my god , what are you gonna do ?
0719_147	joey	i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part .
0719_148	monica	unless
0719_149	joey	unless what ?
0719_150	monica	well , this may sound crazy , but there maybe something we could fashion .
0719_151	joey	like what ?
0719_152	monica	well im not sure yet , but umm of the top of my head im thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat .

0719_154	phoebe	hey ive got a great idea for party favors for the shower . okay , we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyones names in them and inside is everyones individual birth stone .
0719_155	rachel	okay . okay . all right , you take care of that . and meanwhile , the party is tomorrow and we still dont have a guest list .

0805_057	joey's co-star	drake , ive discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss .
0805_058	dr. drake ramoray	what is it ?
0805_059	joey's co-star	apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful . it seems your body is rejecting jessicas brain .

0813_143	chandler	he didnt say anything about that to me .
0813_144	monica	what did he tell you ?

0813_146	monica	okay . so you , me and london . looking at people differently . maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .
0813_147	chandler	but what did he mean by rules ?
0813_148	monica	wait a minute he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in
0813_149	chandler	because he was looking at her differently .
0813_150	monica	and phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules
0813_151	chandler	my god he wants to do it with phoebe in london
0813_152	phoebe	you guys ?
0813_153	monica	just a minute thats mrs. tribbiani

0813_194	ross	veto .
0813_195	rachel	fine .

0903_108	chandler	i know what she 's talking about .
0903_109	rachel	we 've got to find a new pediatrician . ross was getting sick last night , and i think emma may have caught it .
0903_110	monica	why don 't you go see dr. gettleman ?
0903_111	rachel	ross said he died .
0903_112	monica	he didn 't die . i saw his daughter last week . said he was fine . her on the other hand , botched botox .
0903_113	rachel	oh , great well , then i 'm gonna take emma to see him . i wonder why ross said that he died .
0903_114	monica	oh , maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist .
0903_115	chandler	he saw a therapist ?
0903_116	monica	yeah , he used to have this recurring nightmare , just really freaked him out .
0903_117	rachel	why ? what was it ?

0903_123	joey	okay

0903_125	mike	i gotta tell you , i can 't believe i 'm doing this with you . although i did just get out of a nine-year relationship , so i guess i should be open and taking some risks .

0903_142	phoebe	wow , that 's great i liked that better than the law thing , so
0903_143	joey	which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .

0903_203	monica	manhattan .
0903_204	chandler	and you 're thinking of taking it ? so before you said being me with me was more important than any job , but i guess now it 's old job , me , new job .
0903_205	monica	i 'm gonna miss this hand okay i know it 's a lot to ask , but oh my god chandler , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity .
0903_206	chandler	what happened to you can 't live without me four days a week ?
0903_207	monica	well , if you really think about it , i mean four days is not that long . i mean , i see you monday before you go to work , and i see you thursday when you get back , and i always work late on tuesdays , so really if you think about it , it 's really
0903_208	chandler	i think you should take the job .
0903_209	monica	really ?
0903_210	chandler	yeah . i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .
0903_211	monica	that 's the nicest anyone has ever said to me

0903_221	rachel	ross , seriously you 've gotta go to an appropriate doctor .
0903_222	ross	why ? why ? i know it 's a little weird , but hey , he 's a great doctor , okay ? he knows my medical history , and every time i go in there , he makes a big deal . ah look , it 's my favorite patient
0903_223	chandler	does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?
0903_224	ross	hey , i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college
0903_225	chandler	that was not a security blanket that was a wall-hanging
0903_226	ross	it didn 't spend much time on the wall

0903_231	phoebe	why did you go along with that ?

0908_143	ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy	thank you amy .
0908_144	amy	no , no , then i would get the baby . i mean you know it would be just like a movie . like at first i wouldn 't know what to do with her , then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i 'd get married .
0908_145	phoebe	thats a great movie . < she claps >

0908_147	amy	now listen , not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you 'd be dead . i was thinking about changing her name . i 'm just not really a big fan of emily .

0908_150	phoebe	phoe-be .
0908_151	amy turns to ross and rachel	why does she keep making that noise ?
0908_152	rachel	honey , i don 't know how to tell you this , but um , if something were to happen to ross or to myself < ross and rachel knock on wood > um you wouldn 't get the baby .
0908_153	amy	well who would ?
0908_154	ross	well we haven 't offically asked them yet , but we would want monica and chandler .
0908_155	chandler	i can 't believe you 'd want us to raise emma .
0908_156	monica	yeah oh my god , i 'm so moved .
0908_157	amy	i don 't believe this , hold on a second . you guys die and i don 't get your baby ?
0908_158	rachel	see look amy , we 're a lot closer to monica and chandler . we see them every day . and truthfully honey , you don 't seem very connected to the baby .
0908_159	amy	connected ? i mean to what ? she 's she 's a lump .
0908_160	chandler	you know , guys i got to say . this means so much to me . that you would trust me with your child . i mean , we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own . you know i 've had my doubts about my skills as a father ,
0908_161	amy	< points to chandler > this guy ? seriously ?
0908_162	<error>	later in the day .
0908_163	monica	okay it 's time for dinner . everyone we 're using our fancy china um and its very expensive so please be careful .
0908_164	ross starts playing with a plate	woah . woah < nearly really drops the plate and more seriously > woah .
0908_165	monica	okay , just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved . < pinches ross arm >
0908_166	<error>	ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt .
0908_167	joey	hey how come my plate 's less fancy then everyone else 's ? do you not trust me with a fancy plate ?
0908_168	monica	no , honey , its. thats a special plate . see its a game , whoever gets that plate wins .
0908_169	joey	i can 't believe i won .
0908_170	amy	its such a slap in the face . i 'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me .
0908_171	rachel	monica is ross sister .
0908_172	amy	no , ross sister was really fat .
0908_173	monica	that was me .
0908_174	amy	no , she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog .
0908_175	rachel	hey . amy . you 've got to stop doing that .

0908_177	monica about to have a heart attack	okay , listen i know you 're having a little bit of a family crisis , but you don 't have to take it out on the plates . i mean , i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this .

0908_179	monica	now see , this way you protect the plate and lets face it you have fun .
0908_180	amy	okay , how about this , you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies , then do i get the baby ?
0908_181	chandler	no , if crazy plate lad < sees monica frustrated at this comment > if monica dies then i would get emma , right ?

0908_183	rachel	well actually
0908_184	chandler	actually what ?
0908_185	ross	well its just. its just in that case , then um . emma would go to my parents .
0908_186	chandler	what ?
0908_187	amy	hurts , doesn 't it ?

0908_189	joey raises his hand	uh who has to die for me to get her ?

0908_192	chandler	so if monica 's not around , then i 'm not good enough to raise emma ?
0908_193	ross looks down	no , that that is not what we 're saying .
0908_194	joey	yeah he 's lying . he looked down .

0908_196	chandler	well what is wrong with me ? am i am i incomptent ? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
0908_197	rachel	honey , you 're taking this the wrong way . we think you 're going to be a wonderful parent . it 's just you 're more the fun parent .
0908_198	ross	yeah and we 'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin someone who can be firm and strict .
0908_199	monica	thats not how you see me , is it ?
0908_200	phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air	no you 're all about the fun .
0908_201	chandler	look , i may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think i 'm not capable ?
0908_202	ross	no , you both are equally capable . its just you 're strongest when when you 're together .
0908_203	chandler	ok . so if we both had emma and i die < knocks on table > she 'd have to give her up .
0908_204	ross	sure , monica would have to give her up .
0908_205	joey	i lie better then that , right ?
0908_206	chandler	so let me get this straight . so my two friends die , i get emma . then my wife dies , then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me ?
0908_207	phoebe	there 's your movie < claps >

0911_044	monica	you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ? ooh , now i get to use my shredder
0911_045	chandler	i mean , i can write slogans . i mean , how hard can it be , right ? cheese . it 's milk that you chew . crackers . because your cheese needs a buddy . a grape . because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?
0911_046	monica	i got one . socks . because your family 's feet deserve the best .
0911_047	chandler	honey ? leave it to the pros .
0911_048	monica	i actually know someone in advertising . i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency . maybe i can get him to meet you ? give me the phone .

0911_064	phoebe	yeah but i 'm a little shaky and nervous .
0911_065	joey	oh , relax . don 't be . you 'll be fine , you 'll be fine . they 'll probably just make you stand in the back .

0911_082	chandler	no , no . but let me show you what i can do . bagels and donuts . round food for every mood .
0911_083	interviewer	monica warned me you might do that . i actually think we might have something for you at the agency .
0911_084	chandler	really ? that 's great
0911_085	interviewer	it 's an unpaid internship .
0911_086	chandler	it 's funny . when you said unpaid it sounded like you said unpaid .
0911_087	interviewer	come on now . monica has a good job . and it 's not like you have a family to support .
0911_088	chandler	actually , we 're trying , and i don 't think monica 's gonna wanna postpone it . we 're supposed to have sex tonight . actually , she 's probably at home naked right now . i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me . i can just picture her on the bed right now .

0911_090	interviewer	okay .

0911_092	rachel	wait a minute what do you mean , you 're taking over my job ?
0911_093	gavin	well , while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job .
0911_094	rachel	a vacation ? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw .
0911_095	gavin	clearly you 've never been to sandles paradise island .
0911_096	rachel	alright don 't get too comfortable there , because i 'm back in two weeks and i want everything back to the way it was . i can 't say that i care too much for the way you 've rearranged my office .
0911_097	gavin	i can 't say i care too much for that smell you 've brought in with you .
0911_098	rachel	excuse me ?
0911_099	ross	rach we have a code brown situation .
0911_100	rachel	can you please , please take care of it for me ?

0911_102	rachel	let me just get this straight so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job ?
0911_103	gavin	well , there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together .
0911_104	rachel	that 's right . you 're very cheeky for a temp .
0911_105	gavin	i 'm not a temp . i was transferred here from another department .
0911_106	rachel	oh yeah , what department was that ? the jerk department ?
0911_107	gavin	oh , they didn 't tell me about your quick wit .
0911_108	rachel	did they mention that i 'm rubber and you 're glue ?
0911_109	mr. zelner	gavin , ralph loved your ideas .
0911_110	rachel	oh , hi mr. zelner .
0911_111	mr. zelner	rachel , i see you 've met gavin . i must say , when you left us we weren 't sure what we were gonna do . but then , gavin to the rescue . super gavin
0911_112	rachel	that 's great . so now , super gavin , when i come back where are you planning on flying off to ?
0911_113	gavin	well , that 's up to mr. zelner . i 'm sure he will make the right decision .
0911_114	rachel	oh , wow . super ass-kissing power .
0911_115	mr. zelner	incidentally , when are you coming back ?
0911_116	rachel	today .
0911_117	gavin	you said two weeks .
0911_118	rachel	no , i said today see , for a superhero , not so much with the listening .

0911_120	joey	hey .
0911_121	phoebe	hey . so , what did he say ?
0911_122	joey	well , he can be a little rough around the edges , so i 'm gonna replace a word he used a lot , with the word puppy . okay , so he said if your puppy friend doesn 't get her puppy act together , i 'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass .
0911_123	phoebe	i 'm sorry , i can 't do this . i 'm not an actor .
0911_124	joey	that 's right , you 're not . you 're a nurse . you 're nurse with tray .
0911_125	phoebe	joey .
0911_126	joey	no , no . nurse with tray doesn 't know joey , she doesn 't have time for friends . she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor , because if she doesn 't , people die
0911_127	phoebe	who dies ?
0911_128	joey	man with eye patch you get in there and you do your job .
0911_129	phoebe	yes , doctor .

0911_140	rachel	alright , alright . calm down norma rae . they didn 't actually say that . i 'm just afraid if i don 't come back right now this guy 's gonna try to squeeze me out .
0911_141	ross	what about emma ? we don 't have a nanny .
0911_142	rachel	i know . you know , we 're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight . can you please just take care of her for today ?

0911_150	chandler	whatever i decide to do , i 'm gonna be starting a career from scratch . it 's gonna be a while before i make a living at it . maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .
0911_151	ross	so you have to tell monica you don 't want to have a baby right now ?
0911_152	chandler	yeah .
0911_153	ross	good-bye .

0911_157	monica	we 're gonna have sex .
0911_158	ross	i don 't feel like having sex . maybe we can watch a movie or something .
0911_159	monica	let me put it this way . we 're having sex whether you 're here or not .
0911_160	ross	pants off bing

0911_162	rachel	alright . now that i 'm back , why don 't you just fill me in on what you 've been up to ?
0911_163	gavin	well , i 've changed your screensaver from that picture of nsync .
0911_164	rachel	hey , they were popular when i left
0911_165	gavin	also , i 've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow .
0911_166	rachel	well , i should be involved in that , so why don 't you get me up to speed ?
0911_167	gavin	that 's gonna take weeks . why don 't just let me take care of the presentation ?
0911_168	rachel	oh , no no no no . i see what you 're doing here , alright , listen , this is my job buddy . okay , i 've had it for five years , and i know how it works , so why don 't you just catch me up
0911_169	gavin	fine .
0911_170	rachel	oh god . you 've totally messed with the back support of my chair . how do you fix this ?
0911_171	gavin	hey , you 've been here five years , you figure it out .
0911_172	rachel	fine , i will . alright , fill me in

0911_174	ross	hey .
0911_175	chandler	hey .
0911_176	ross	you have a blue tie that would go with this ? emma spit up on mine .
0911_177	chandler	oh , yeah . but you have to give it back if i get a job . of course , by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we 'll all be wearing silver jump suits .
0911_178	monica	hi , good morning lover . i gotta say after last night , i 'm a little weak in the knees .
0911_179	ross	here 's an idea . you walk into a room take a quick scan
0911_180	monica	sorry . but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .
0911_181	chandler	oh god , i have to tell you something . you 're not pregnant .
0911_182	monica	what are you talking about ?
0911_183	chandler	that thing that i have to do to make a baby . i faked it .
0911_184	monica	what ? you faked it ?
0911_185	ross	you know what ? i don 't need a tie . i mean , it 's better , open collar . you know , it 's more casual

0911_187	phoebe	joey , listen . i can 't do this , it doesn 't make any sense . yesterday i was a nurse , and today i 'm a waitress at a cafe ?
0911_188	joey	oh , sometimes we use the same extras for different parts . it 's okay .
0911_189	phoebe	well , it 's not okay , because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse . and now suddenly i 'm the waitress ? that 's gonna confuse my fans .
0911_190	joey	maybe you are a nurse , but you moonlight as a waitress .
0911_191	phoebe	uhuh . because i 'm a single mother , supporting my two children .
0911_192	joey	nice .
0911_193	phoebe	wait a minute . dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital . wouldn 't i come over to say hi to him ?
0911_194	joey	no , no . see , you and drake are having a fight .
0911_195	phoebe	about what ?
0911_196	joey	he slept with you and then never called you .
0911_197	phoebe	and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky .
0911_198	director	okay , okay , from the top . and action
0911_199	man	so , i 'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me .
0911_200	<error>	joey drake i 'm surprised to , but yet here i am .

0911_202	director	cut , cut what are you doing ?
0911_203	phoebe	yeah , well , i 'm very angry at him , because he slept with me and never called me back .
0911_204	extra	me too
0911_205	another extra	me too
0911_206	joey	oh , calm down she means on the show we need some new extras around here

0911_208	gavin	wow , you 're here already .
0911_209	rachel	yes . emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation . i actually made a few changes , but i think i 'm caught up on everything . so ask me anything
0911_210	gavin	how do you fix the chair ?
0911_211	rachel	except that oh , hello , mr. zelner . we 're all ready for our presentation this afternoon .
0911_212	mr. zelner	good , because it 's in ten minutes .
0911_213	rachel	what ? i can 't do that i have the baby , and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour .
0911_214	mr. zelner	well , then gavin can give the presentation , okay , we have to do it now . ralph needs to leave early today . he 's going helicopter shopping .
0911_215	rachel	well , there you go . you win , you win . you get to do the presentation , you 'll knock em dead , no one will ever remember that i worked here , and then ralph will buy his helicopter , and super gavin will just fly right along side of him
0911_216	gavin	you can do the presentation .
0911_217	rachel	no , i can 't , i have a baby .
0911_218	gavin	i 'll watch her .
0911_219	rachel	why would you do that ?
0911_220	gavin	because you 've worked really hard , and it 's your job , and you 're a little crazy .
0911_221	rachel	that 's really nice .
0911_222	gavin	i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .
0911_223	rachel	then you 're not gonna like what 's coming . i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry . thank you , thank you .
0911_224	gavin	i 'm really fine , don 't worry , i 'm great with children . gavin mitchell . pleased to meet you .

0911_226	joey	please don 't fire my friend . just let me talk to her .
0911_227	director	okay , okay . but this is her last chance .
0911_228	joey	thank you , thank you . how about i do something for you ? tomorrow , i 'll bring you a hat , cover up the bald ?
0911_229	joey	hey , listen pheebs . i was just talking to the director , and he was thinking , maybe this time you don 't hit drake , you just wait on the tables ?
0911_230	phoebe	i can 't do that . i 'm an actor . i have a process .
0911_231	joey	you 're a masseuse . you have a table with a hole in it .
0911_232	phoebe	wait a minute , i see what 's happening here . you 're threatened .
0911_233	joey	what ?
0911_234	phoebe	yeah , i 'm so good in this scene that i 'm stealing focus from you . well , rise to the challenge tribianni cause i just raised the bar . come join me up here
0911_235	joey	yeah , you can fire her , but i would call security , she won 't go easy .

0911_237	monica	you faked it ? you couldn 't have faked it
0911_238	chandler	oh yes you can . you just make the faces and the noises .
0911_239	monica	guys can fake it ? unbelievable . the one thing that 's ours besides , why would you fake it when we 're trying to have a baby ?
0911_240	chandler	that 's actually why . look , i 'm starting a whole new career now , and i 'm not saying that i don 't want to have a baby , i 'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while .
0911_241	monica	like a month ?
0911_242	chandler	or a year ?
0911_243	monica	really , you want to wait a year ?
0911_244	chandler	it could be less than a year . i mean , you 've heard my stuff . pants . like shorts , but longer . it 'll probably be more than a year .
0911_245	monica	i really wanna have a baby .
0911_246	chandler	yeah , me too . look , i 'll just get my old job back .
0911_247	monica	no , i want you to have a job that you love . not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .
0911_248	chandler	i quit and you learn what i do ?
0911_249	monica	it 's just , i think , there 's never gonna be a right time to have a baby . i mean , now you 're unemployed and in a little while you 'll find a new job that 'll keep you really busy . there 's always gonna be a reason not to do this , but i think
0911_250	chandler	i guess . it 's always gonna be scary when we have a baby .
0911_251	monica	it 's gonna be really scary . i mean , god . when we have a baby , there 's gonna be so much that we 're not able to control . i mean , the apartment 's gonna be a mess , i won 't have time to clean it . what if the baby gets into the ribbon
0911_252	chandler	should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?
0911_253	monica	yes , please
0911_254	chandler	oh , and i promise , i will not fake it this time .
0911_255	monica	i wish i could say the same . i 'm a little shook up

0911_257	<error>	joey drake i know you botched that operation on purpose . i can 't prove it yet , but when i do , you 'll be going to jail for murder . i don 't care if you are my brother .

0912_052	phoebe	so weird , you think he 's so gross and you 're willing to eat his crackers .

0912_056	rachel	gavin , i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation . i really owe you an appology .
0912_057	gavin	for what ?
0912_058	rachel	well , when we first met , you know , i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious
0912_059	gavin	is this your first appology ?
0912_060	rachel	no , i just mean that , you know , first impressions don 't mean anything . and i-i think you 're a really good guy and i 'm sorry that i misjudged you .

0912_062	heather	good morning
0912_063	rachel	hello . but you know what , hey , new day , new leaf , i am just really really happy i 'm sorry , obviously heather 's ass has something more important to say so i 'll just wait till it 's finished .
0912_064	gavin	what ?
0912_065	rachel	i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out
0912_066	gavin	i wasn 't checking her out . i 'm in fashion , i was looking at her skirt . or was it pants ? i didn 't really see what happened below the ass area .
0912_067	rachel	oh wow , you are really , you 're really a creep .
0912_068	gavin	why do you even care if i was looking at her ? are you jealous ?
0912_069	rachel	oh yeah , i 'm jealous . oh gavin , please , please look at my ass . stop looking at my ass i mean , i just think you are totally inappropriate , ok ? this is a work environment , she 's your subordinate .
0912_070	gavin	i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag .
0912_071	rachel	that is totally different for two reasons . one i didn 't know that you knew that . and two , i wasn 't some creep staring at his ass , we had a deap meaningful relationship .
0912_072	gavin	huh . what 's tag 's last name ?
0912_073	rachel	it was oh my god . he didn 't have a last name . it was just tag . you know , like cher , or , you know , moses .
0912_074	gavin	but it was a deap meaningful relationship .
0912_075	rachel	oh , you know what my first impression of you was absolutely right . you are arrogant , you are pompous morgan morgan tag 's last name was morgan huh
0912_076	gavin	it was jones .
0912_077	rachel	yeah well what are you , his boyfriend ?

0912_079	joey	man , i wish i had a nanny like you .
0912_080	molly	you mean , when you were a baby .
0912_081	joey	sure .

0912_083	monica	would you stop staring at her ?
0912_084	chandler	i wasn 't staring . i was leering .
0912_085	monica	what 's the big deal with her ? maybe she 's attractive in an obvious kind of way .
0912_086	ross	yeah , obvious beauty 's the worst . you know , when it 's right there in your face . me , i like to have to work to find someone attractive . makes me feel like i earned it .
0912_087	chandler	looks like joey is doing allright with her .
0912_088	monica	yeah . hey , that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once .
0912_089	molly	i 'm gonna take her back to the appartment .
0912_090	ross	ok , i 'll be home right after work . ok , by emma-wemma-demma , i love you wovyou dovyou

0912_094	ross, joey and chandler	bye , emma-wemma-demma .
0912_095	rachel	hey , listen , joey , about molly , i really prefer if you didn 't go after her .
0912_096	joey	why not ?
0912_097	rachel	because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn 't want anything to , you know , drive her away .
0912_098	joey	so , what , you think i 'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ? yeah , sounds about right .
0912_099	ross	come on , there are plenty of other women out thereok ? just just forget about her , ok ? just , she 's off limits .
0912_100	joey	oh , man , why did have to go and say that for ? now that you told me i can 't have it makes me want her even more
0912_101	ross	what are you , a child ?

0912_107	phoebe	hey mikey
0912_108	mike	hey p
0912_109	phoebe	what are you doing ?
0912_110	mike	setting rat traps .
0912_111	phoebe	to kill bob ? ?
0912_112	mike	no , no , to test his neck strength .
0912_113	phoebe	no , mike , i don 't want to kill him i thought we were just gonna capture him and , and you know , set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .
0912_114	mike	ok , ok , i 'll throw away the traps .
0912_115	phoebe	i 'll find bob , i 'll get him . bob ? bob robert oh wait , i think i hear him . oh oh my god bob had babies bob 's a mom
0912_116	mike	better think of a new name for him .
0912_117	phoebe	i don 't know , i kinda like bob for a girl .
0912_118	mike	i don 't know , i mean i 'm not sure
0912_119	phoebe	oh my god , we killed bob
0912_120	mike	maybe it wasn 't bob , maybe it was a mouse .
0912_121	phoebe	suzie ?

0912_123	ross	whazzup ? ?
0912_124	chandler	seriously dude , 3 years ago .
0912_125	ross	listen , can you do me a favor ? i 'm gonna be out today . can you just keep an eye on joey , make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?
0912_126	chandler	you don 't trust him ?
0912_127	ross	wh no . some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter , the hot nanny .
0912_128	chandler	is this really your long term plan , for me to run interference ? because i could get a job any day now .
0912_129	ross	you do appear right on the cusp of something . come on man , i 'm sure he 'll lose interest in a week or two , but for now can you please just do this for me ?
0912_130	chandler	allright , fine , but don 't blame me if it doesn 't work . because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something , more often than not , he 's going to have sex with it .
0912_131	ross	well we gotta do something , ok ? nannies like her don 't grow on trees .
0912_132	chandler	picturing that tree ?

0912_141	joey	allright , fine , i only have one thought it 's about the hot nanny , i gotta see her
0912_142	chandler	i 'm afraid i can 't let you do that , joe .

0912_144	chandler	yes , as a matter of fact he did , so i can 't let you go .
0912_145	joey	huh . interesting . now there are obstacles . hot nanny and me against the world . this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .

0912_228	phoebe	ok , ok , you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed .
0912_229	mike	hey , when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats ?
0912_230	phoebe	well , you know what , they 're our responsibility now .
0912_231	mike	ok , fine , these rats are our responsibility . what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?
0912_232	phoebe	mate ? they 're all brothers and sisters .
0912_233	mike	yeah not such a problem with rats . no , they 're more of a love the one you 're with kind of animals .
0912_234	phoebe	no . wh get off your sister oh my god , what are we gonna do ? we have 7 rats . so what if each of them has 7 rats ? and then each of those have 7 rats ? that 's like that 's math i can 't even do what are we gonna do ?
0912_235	mike	well , i know this is gonna sound crazy , but , we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .
0912_236	phoebe	yeah , ok . i guess you 're right . allright , so we should just give them away . but to nice families , with children , and reduced fat wheat thins . they 're bob 's favorites .
0912_237	mike	it 's gonna be ok .
0912_238	phoebe	you must think i 'm crazy .
0912_239	mike	no , i think you 're sweet .
0912_240	phoebe	good . it 's just so hard , it 's hard for me to let them go . i guess it just brings back memories , you know , from when i gave birth to my brother 's triplets and i had to give them up . i haven 't told you about that yet , have i ?

0912_263	gavin	i 'm not sure .

0913_009	ross	ok you you really don 't know what i am talking about ?
0913_010	chandler	no
0913_011	ross	ok last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .
0913_012	chandler	our balcony ? seriously ? that 's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony . and she said no , no . it 's too cold , nobody will go out there . and i said maybe if we put some light out there they will
0913_013	ross	right that 's why i came over to talk about . hum i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony , even though there were no lights
0913_014	chandler	so are you gonna talk to her ?
0913_015	ross	why why should i ? i mean if she wants to move on , that 's fine
0913_016	chandler	you know when that 's fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits
0913_017	ross	no i 'm serious . i mean she wants to date people ? fine i don 't care but at least she could have told me . you know i i 've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows , then so will
0913_018	chandler	no no no . good . so you 're moving on ? do you have any idea where you 're moving ?
0913_019	ross	i don 't know . i mean i have plenty of opportunity . just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me . and then the other day on the subway a woman accidentally sat on my hand .
0913_020	chandler	dude , don 't rub my face in your crazy single life
0913_021	ross	well , and how about this ? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental potluck dinner .
0913_022	chandler	why did i get married ?

0913_028	joey	hey let me ask you guys something . i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed . is that weird for a guy ?
0913_029	phoebe	well it depends .
0913_030	joey	on ?
0913_031	phoebe	on how far along he 's in the sex change process
0913_032	monica	no i totally disagree . no i think it 's fine for a guy to do something like that . such you an actor . not that you need to , your eyebrows are
0913_033	joey	ok stop it you guys stop staring you 're freaking me out
0913_034	phoebe	your knuckles are kinda hairy too

0913_036	phoebe	wow talking about high maintenance
0913_037	joey	hey hey you dye your hair
0913_038	phoebe	i 'm a woman
0913_039	joey	arghhh double standards
0913_040	phoebe	oh before i forget , are you coming to mike 's piano bar tonight ?
0913_041	monica	only if i don 't have to get up and sing .
0913_042	phoebe	but everybody sings . it 's so much fun last time this adorable old man got out there , forgot all of the words , flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage . so funny .
0913_043	monica	it 's just , i 'm not good at singing .
0913_044	phoebe	oh what 's the matter ? are you scared ? you 're afraid i 'm a better singer ? you 're afraid i 'm gonna beat you at singing ?
0913_045	monica	no no , it 's not working on me . wow i must be growing up
0913_046	phoebe	ok fine please come and support mike . you don 't have to sing .
0913_047	monica	so i don 't have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others ?
0913_048	phoebe	while drinking
0913_049	monica	i 'm there
0913_050	rachel	hi guys listen i really need your help . i think i did something really stupid .
0913_051	phoebe	well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
0913_052	rachel	no not that . i kissed gavin last night .
0913_053	phoebe	oh my god .
0913_054	monica	you kissed him ?
0913_055	rachel	yeah . it was after the party , we were on the balcony and
0913_056	monica	wait wait wait . i was at home the whole time . how did i missed that ?
0913_057	phoebe	it was the end of the party , you were probably ironing wrapping paper .
0913_058	monica	oh yeah so how did you end up kissing ?
0913_059	rachel	you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and , oh and he gave me this scarf
0913_060	monica	i thought you hated him ?
0913_061	rachel	you know honey , there is a thin line between love and hate , and it turns out that line is a scarf
0913_062	monica	so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ?
0913_063	rachel	i don 't know . it 's so complicated . i work with this guy , you know , i have the baby , and i have ross , and i just i don 't know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .
0913_064	monica	sounds like you need to think about what you want , talk to gavin , and you definitely should talk to ross
0913_065	rachel	or i could call in sick and not deal with it at all
0913_066	phoebe	wow five-month maternity leave , you 're back for four days , kiss a co-worker , call in sick , they are lucky to have you

0913_069	salon girl	hi

0913_084	chandler	hey it 's the most eligible man in ny . how 's the moving on going ?
0913_085	ross	not well . i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .
0913_086	chandler	well maybe you 're going about this the wrong way . you know i mean think about it . single white male , divorced three times , two illegitimate children . the personal ad writes itself
0913_087	ross	that 's funny do you think you 'll ever work again ?
0913_088	chandler	what are doing ? you know i can only dish it out

0913_312	ross	the guy you gave your number to .
0913_313	rachel	whoa , how do you know about that ?
0913_314	ross	because he called here looking for you . so dont tell me this this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing , ok ? youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now . and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .
0913_315	rachel	why didnt i get that message ?
0913_316	ross	what ?
0913_317	rachel	from the guy in the bar , why didnt i get that message ?
0913_318	ross	because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket . do you do you not look there ?
0913_319	rachel	ross ?
0913_320	ross	i never gave it to you .
0913_321	rachel	why ?
0913_322	ross	i dont know .

0913_326	ross	i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys
0913_327	rachel	oh my god , i cannot believe this . you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment
0913_328	ross	none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me thats not the point . ok ? the point is you you are the one who moved on and didnt tell anyone
0913_329	rachel	oh , ross , this is just so messed up whats wrong with us ? you know when people hear about our situation they always ask , what , you live together but youre not a couple ? and you have a baby , isnt that weird ? and i say no . you know what , its not ,
0913_330	ross	uh , clearly .
0913_331	rachel	and you know , we said that we would , we would live together as long as this makes sense . an maybe this , you know , just doesnt make sense anymore .

0913_337	rachel	hi . can emma and i live here for a while ?

0914_001	<error>	transcribed by marita bakken

0914_006	rachel	oh , joey , it 's so great to be back here . i gotta tell you , you 're making it so easy on me and emma .
0914_007	joey	hey , it 's great having you back . you know , stay as long as you want , and when does she stop crying all night ?

0914_009	ross	hey , you 're not naked so hey , rach , when will we expect to see you tonight ?
0914_010	rachel	well , i 'll probably be back to pick her up around six , but she 's in the bedroom all ready to go . but she did actually fall back to sleep , so
0914_011	joey	she 's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .
0914_012	rachel	bye

0914_014	ross	bye hey , i hope emma isn 't making it too hard on you .
0914_015	joey	no , hey , it 's been great .
0914_016	ross	yeah ?
0914_017	joey	yeah . and look , i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything , all my feelings from before are totally over , okay ? and even if they weren 't , when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump
0914_018	ross	yeah , that 'll do it .
0914_019	joey	wow so , how are you ?
0914_020	ross	i 'm , i 'm okay .
0914_021	joey	really ?
0914_022	ross	sure , i mean , do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ? of course . you know , i 'm disappointed , but it 's not like it 's a divorce .
0914_023	joey	well , actually it
0914_024	ross	no , it 's not a divorce , it is not a divorce anyway , i think rachel and i need to , you know , get on with our lives , maybe , maybe start seeing other people .
0914_025	joey	wow , really ?
0914_026	ross	yeah , sure , why not ? in fact , if you know anyone that would be good for me
0914_027	joey	sure , i know lots of girls .
0914_028	ross	yeah ? any names come to mind ?
0914_029	joey	ooh , names ?

0914_032	phoebe	hey .
0914_033	joey	hey . i was just gonna get something to eat . you want something ?

0914_035	joey (checks the refrigerator)	okay , let 's see , we got strained peas , strained carrots ooh strained plums . we haven 't tried that yet .
0914_036	phoebe	goodie thanks . so , how is it living with rachel again ? i mean , apart from the great food .
0914_037	joey	i 'm fine , i 'm fine , it 's just , it 's just weird what 's happening with her and ross . you know , yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .
0914_038	phoebe	oh my god , rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .
0914_039	joey	why are they doing this ?
0914_040	phoebe	i don 't know . they 're so perfect for each other it 's crazy .
0914_041	joey	you know what 's crazy ? these jars . what is it , like two bites in here ?
0914_042	phoebe	i just wish they 'd realise they should be together .
0914_043	joey	i know , i know . and when they moved back in together , i figured y 'know , that 's where things were headed .
0914_044	phoebe	i know . they should be a family . they should get married and have more children .
0914_045	joey	yes , and they should name one of their kids joey . i may not have kids someone 's gotta carry on the family name .
0914_046	phoebe	you know what ? maybe once they start dating , and they see what 's out there , they 'll realise how good they are for each other .
0914_047	joey	yeah , because it is slim pickings . i had this date last night yuck but we should probably keep it down she 's still in the bedroom .
0914_048	phoebe	so , what are we gonna do ? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?
0914_049	joey	i know that just pushes them further and further apart .
0914_050	phoebe	yeah . oh , i know what we can do . we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates , so that they 'll realise how good they are together .
0914_051	joey	ooh , that 's a great plan
0914_052	phoebe	yeah , you know what the best part of it is ? i get to do my plan-laugh .

0914_054	joey	shhh not so loud , we don 't wanna wake up , uh

0914_058	monica	hey
0914_059	rachel	you guys aren 't doing anything tonight , are you ?
0914_060	chandler	see , now , why would you assume that ? just because we 're married ? i will have you know that we are very hip , happening people . now , if you 'll excuse me , i have to get back to reading the obituaries .
0914_061	rachel	i was just asking cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .
0914_062	monica	sure , we 'll do that . what are you up to ?

0914_126	monica	chandler
0914_127	chandler	i am not working . there 's not much to do around here

0914_129	ross	excuse me , is there a woman waiting at the bar ? someone average height , dark hair , perhaps doing a puzzle ?
0914_130	waiter	uh , there 's a drunk chinese guy .
0914_131	ross	well , if i 'm still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me .
0914_132	waiter	can i get you another glass of wine ?
0914_133	ross	nah , i don 't know if i should . i don 't wanna be drunk when i go home alone .
0914_134	waiter	got stood up , huh ?
0914_135	ross	yeah , it 's no big deal . it 's just a blind date .
0914_136	waiter	are you worried your date came , saw you , and left ?
0914_137	ross	no

0914_140	monica	we 're okay . i 'm still ovulating .

0914_142	monica	so , let 's do this .
0914_143	chandler	i i don 't think i can .
0914_144	monica	come on . i know you 're not eighteen anymore , but give it a minute .
0914_145	chandler	because of emma .

0914_149	chandler	well , she 's aware when we leave the room . she may notice if we start canoodling in it .
0914_150	monica	canoodling ?
0914_151	chandler	well , i can 't say hump or screw in front of the b-a-b-y .
0914_152	monica	i don 't know . i mean , i guess having sex in front of a baby isn 't so
0914_153	chandler	horrifying ? scarring ? something people go to jail for ?
0914_154	monica	i guess you 're right .
0914_155	chandler	you guess i 'm right ? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast , you wouldn 't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .
0914_156	monica	but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer ?

0914_158	rachel	wow , everything looks so good i think i 'm gonna have the chicken .
0914_159	steve (staring at rachel)	i i just have to say this you 're really beautiful .

0914_164	rachel (feeling awkward)	so , what do think you wanna order ? i 'm really excited about that chicken .
0914_165	steve	i 'm not funny either . so , if you were thinking , well , he 's not that good-looking , but maybe we 'll have some laughs that ain 't gonna happen .
0914_166	rachel	well , come on , steve let 's not rule out nervous laughter . hey , now wait a minute . phoebe told me that that you owned your own restaurant . that 's impressive .
0914_167	steve	i lost it . to drugs .

0914_169	steve	i silk-screen t-shirts now .
0914_170	rachel	really ? what 's that like ?
0914_171	steve	it 's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money . that 's right . i have no money , i 'm not funny , i live in a studio apartment with two other guys , and i 'm pretty sure i 'm infertile .
0914_172	rachel (awkward chuckle)	now , come on , come on , steve . there must be something that you like about yourself .

0917_044	phoebe	ok . i mean i know i did the right thing . you know , mike never wants to get married and i shouldn 't be in a relationship that has no future but pretty soon i 'm gonna miss him so much . i 'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that
0917_045	monica	ok , you got it
0917_046	phoebe	unless maybe it 's too crazy about this alright so you know , there is no future but that doesn 't mean we still can 't have fun . you know what ? forget what i said .

0917_052	chandler	i believe i read that somewhere
0917_053	ross	that only is not funny , it 's physically impossible ok ? depending on the species i 'd have to have a six foot long it 's not funny
0917_054	chandler	i respectfully disagree .
0917_055	ross	i can 't believe you put that on my alumni page
0917_056	chandler	who cares ? nobody reads those things
0917_057	ross	you 'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .
0917_058	chandler	i don 't have a page .
0917_059	ross	oh oh oh i respectfully disagree

0917_061	joey	look at you , all sweet and innocent , sleeping like an angel with emma 's chubby little hands wrapped around ya . it 's okay , emma , you stay asleep .

0917_067	joey	there you go sweetie this isn 't over .

0917_069	monica	alright , wait a second , why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as gay as the day is long ?

0917_174	ross	eh actually no , i don 't need to because your little ross is dead joke didn 't work , ok , there were no responses . nobody posted anything on the website , nobody called my parents , so the joke my friend is on you . nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that i 'm
0917_175	chandler	no , come on , you know that 's not true .
0917_176	ross	what are you talking about ? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet i didn 't get one response and i 'm dead
0917_177	chandler	well , the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .
0917_178	ross	i can 't believe this . not even my geology lab partner ? and i carried that guy
0917_179	chandler	alright look , let 's think about this , ok , do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ? that people are gonna post condolences on a website ? this is not about people not caring that you 're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their
0917_180	ross	you 're right . there isn 't a decent outlet .
0917_181	chandler	right , i mean , come on , i 'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service , tons of people would come .
0917_182	ross	exactly
0917_183	chandler	ross , what 're you what 're you what are you doing ? you 're having a memorial service for yourself ?

0917_197	joey	she 's being unreasonable
0917_198	rachel	joey , there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don 't cover its ears it 's because it reminds her of her uncle joey

0917_280	kori	i can 't believe that ross is gone . it is just so sad .
0917_281	chandler	i didn 't know ross and you were so close .
0917_282	kori	we weren 't but we had one class together . he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science . i always remembered him .
0917_283	chandler	i 'm sure that would mean a lot to him . and if heaven has a door , i 'm sure he 's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
0917_284	kori	i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out . i guess i really missed my chance .
0917_285	ross	but you didn 't i 'm still alive kori , i know this is a big surprise for you . it 's a long story but the things you just said really made my day i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people
0917_286	kori	you sick freak , who does that ? i can 't believe i had a crush on you
0917_287	ross	did you hear that ? kori weston had a crush on me

0917_290	ross	no mum , i 'm not dead . i know it 's not something to kid about . it was just a practical joke between chandler and me , but it 's over , ok ? actually no , even if i had died , you would not be left childless . monica ?

0918_017	phoebe	hey will you get me tickets too ?

0918_026	ross	no do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ? i i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .
0918_027	chandler	yes but there 's six of us so we 'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times .
0918_028	joey	i like those odds
0918_029	ross	seriously you guys , i can 't believe you 're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery , i mean that 's such a bunch of boohaki .

0918_174	phoebe	oh , you guys we 've got to keep all the tickets together
0918_175	monica	no , no we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them

0919_181	rachel	can i ask you a question ?
0919_182	monica	yeah .
0919_183	rachel	have you ever had any weird romantic dreams ?
0919_184	monica	let me think . oh , when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese , and on our wedding night i ate his head .
0919_185	rachel	ok , well this is like that in no way . i had a i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .
0919_186	monica	wow , do you mean like kiss him-kiss him ?
0919_187	rachel	oh yeah i mean , that was pretty intense .
0919_188	monica	what do you think brought than on ?
0919_189	rachel	i don 't know i mean , maybe that 's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .
0919_190	monica	a love scene ? with who ?
0919_191	rachel	olivia .
0919_192	monica	olivia ? i thought she was marrying connor oh right , real life more important .
0919_193	rachel	so do you think that my dream means anything ?
0919_194	monica	i don 't know . i mean , you saw him do a love scene , so maybe you don 't have a thing for joey , maybe you have a thing for drake .
0919_195	rachel	ah well it was joey reading drake 's lines in the dream
0919_196	monica	of course it was trust me , when it comes to psychology i know what i 'm talking about . i took two psych classes in college .
0919_197	rachel	you took the same class twice .
0919_198	monica	it was hard

0919_203	monica	oh phoebe ? maybe i wasn 't clear before . i really love listening to your music here , but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .
0919_204	phoebe	right , yeah , ok , i 'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .
0919_205	monica	phoebe , it 's not what you wear . it 's sort of your songs i just don 't think you should play at the restaurant anymore .

0919_211	monica	i didn 't say your songs were not good enough .
0919_212	phoebe	then what 's wrong with them ? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?

0919_214	phoebe	yeah well , excuse me , i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer , but i can 't see it , i can 't see it
0919_215	monica	phoebe , it 's not about quantity .
0919_216	phoebe	well it 's not about quality .
0919_217	monica	oh really , you want to talk about quality ? have you heard of a key ? it 's what some people sing in .
0919_218	phoebe	well at least all my songs don 't taste like garlic . yeah , there are other ingredients monica .
0919_219	monica	ok , so that 's what we 're doing . you know , when i 'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs , i 'm wearing ear plugs .
0919_220	phoebe	ear plugs , or cloves of garlic ?
0919_221	monica	you know what ? i take back what i said before . you keep playing at the restaurant , because with your music driving people inside , my bar sales are going up like crazy .

0919_252	phoebe	ok , ok , how many of you enjoyed the music outside ? ha
0919_253	monica	alright , let me ask you this question how many of you thought the music was fine , but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ? .
0919_254	phoebe	ok , well , who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?
0919_255	monica	ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?
0919_256	phoebe	ok , well , alright , who thinks the food is fine , the music was fine , but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ? .
0919_257	monica	excuse us alright here 's a question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?
0919_258	phoebe	oh who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend 's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great
0919_259	monica	i 'm sorry
0919_260	phoebe	i 'm sorry too
0919_261	monica	ooohh hey wanna stick around and i 'll whip you up some dinner ?

0919_275	joey	what ?
0919_276	rachel	what how is it going with drake ?

0919_279	joey	well , i 'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow
0919_280	rachel	joey , is this that thing that you do when you say you 're bad so i 'll give you a compliment ?
0919_281	joey	a little . yeah no , i really am worried , you know , i mean i have to make it convincing that i 'm in love with olivia .

0919_287	joey	what the hell are you talking about ? ?
0919_288	rachel	alright , alright look , just uh just try to remember how you felt when you were in love , and think about that when you 're playing the scene .
0919_289	joey	oh ok , yeah , i think i can do that . yeah ok , there 's this party scene coming up and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can 't and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab
0919_290	rachel	joey , you never you never talked about that before
0919_291	joey	well hey , you know what else i could use ? there 's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia 's bedroom , and she doesn 't know he 's there which never happened with us and he knows he shouldn 't be there , but he just wants to look at her you know ? and i remember all

0923-0924_065	chandler	david , let me stop you there cause i think i see where this is going . i 'm not very good at giving advice . so if you want advice , go to ross , monica , or joey , if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .

0923-0924_113	monica	wow that mike thing was interesting i don 't know what 's gonna happen with phoebe and david .
0923-0924_114	chandler	i do want a hint ? huh ? i do i do .
0923-0924_115	monica	ok , i 'm sensing that this is some kind of word play , because you are pink with barely controlled glee .
0923-0924_116	chandler	david is going to propose to phoebe .
0923-0924_117	monica	what ? why ?
0923-0924_118	chandler	be-cause , we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .
0923-0924_119	monica	chandler , we have talked about this . you are not supposed to give people advice now couldn 't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?
0923-0924_120	chandler	i did a penis one look , just so i know , what was so wrong about what i said ?
0923-0924_121	monica	they 've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike she 'll say no , david 's heart will be broken , it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .
0923-0924_122	chandler	man , that 's some bad advice

0923-0924_125	joey	oh hey thank god you guys are here

0923-0924_352	david	ok , i 'm gonna take off .
0923-0924_353	phoebe	david , i 'm so sorry , i 'm sorry .
0923-0924_354	david	just so i know , if i had asked first
0923-0924_355	phoebe	yeah , i might have said yes , but that would have been wrong .
0923-0924_356	david	please , you don 't have to explain . i mean , perhaps if i hadn 't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us . and i wouldn 't have ruined my career , or lost that toe to frostbite . it was a good trip
0923-0924_357	mike	is it ok if i hug you now ?
0923-0924_358	phoebe	yes
0923-0924_359	monica	because of our meddling alright ?

0923-0924_362	monica	i know

0923-0924_364	rachel	open your drapes open your drapes
0923-0924_365	chandler	i 'm so glad we 've got adjoining rooms

0923-0924_367	monica	the sun is out
0923-0924_368	chandler	hey remember when i had corneas ?
0923-0924_369	monica	ok listen , you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs , and i 'll get the magazines and the lotion .
0923-0924_370	chandler	ladies ? ross 's speech is in 45 minutes .
0923-0924_371	rachel	nooo
0923-0924_372	monica	damn it
0923-0924_373	ross	walls are pretty thin , guys

0923-0924_375	ross	then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .
0923-0924_376	rachel	look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan so leathery and wrinkled , i 'm so jealous
0923-0924_377	ross	finally , factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus , argentinasaurus
0923-0924_378	chandler	not to mention the cold sores .

0923-0924_380	ross	and that 's just the herbivores . i 'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores , their heads are already too big . which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .

0923-0924_382	chandler	really ?
0923-0924_383	ross	but all kidding aside , in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus

0923-0924_386	joey	he said erectus
0923-0924_387	charlie	you 're you 're kidding , right ?
0923-0924_388	joey	no , he really said it .
0923-0924_389	ross	and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus

0923-0924_391	joey	erectus ?
0923-0924_392	rachel	homo .

0923-0924_394	ross	in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century . thank you

1001_350	precious	he proposed to you ? this is the worst birthday ever .
1001_351	phoebe	look , precious mike 's not worth this . you 're an attractive , intelligent woman and let 's face it , mike 's kind of a wang . i mean , he proposed to me while he was still seeing you he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday ? and , i don 't like to kiss-and-tell
1001_352	precious	oh , my god , maybe you 're right . maybe i don 't need him . i deserve to be treated with respect .

1002_008	joey (to rachel)	dude , chill okay , we also kissed in barbados , but we didn 't plan it , okay ? and the only reason that that happened was because i saw you kissing charlie .
1002_009	rachel	yeah , you started it i 've got to chill .

1002_126	monica	well , we appreciate anything you can tell us .
1002_127	colleen	well , actually , i think this might help .

1002_129	colleen	it 's pretty much all the information you need .
1002_130	monica	oh my god
1002_131	colleen	everything is broken down into categories , and then cross-referenced , and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back .
1002_132	monica	thank you . i think i just had a tiny orgasm .
1002_133	bill	i know the process is frustrating , but it 's so worth it . adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .

1002_173	charlie	oh , i 'm sorry , have i made this evening uncomfortable ?

1002_175	ross	fajitas be careful , very hot plate , very hot plate

1002_184	phoebe	alice would never go for it , right ?
1002_185	frank jr.	oh , i don 't know , she 's pretty tired , too , i think we 've got her onboard .
1002_186	phoebe	well , just you know , for argument 's sake , you know , hypothetically . which one would you be willing to give up ?
1002_187	frank jr.	huh .
1002_188	phoebe	frank jr.jr. ?
1002_189	frank jr.	oh , you 'd be getting a really good one . i mean , you know , he 's really funny . like , the other day he made up this joke .

1002_191	frank jr.	what 's green and says hey , i 'm a frog ? a talking frog oh , no , you can 't have him , he 's too funny .
1002_192	phoebe	well , alright , that 's fine . what about leslie ?
1002_193	frank jr.	oh , no , no . not leslie . no , she 's , she 's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet .
1002_194	phoebe	alright , so that leaves chandler .
1002_195	frank jr.	oh , no , no , you can 't have chandler , no . no , no . she 's my little genius . i got big hopes for her . she 's gonna be a doctor or a realtor
1002_196	phoebe	wow , frank . i think we just ran out of kids .
1002_197	frank jr.	oh , i think you 're right . oh , wow . phoebe , i don 't think i can give one of them up . i mean , you know , they drive me crazy , but they 're my babies .
1002_198	phoebe	i 'm sorry , frank . i didn 't realise things were so bad . you know , i 'll help out more . i can i can babysit any time you want . you name the day , and i 'll be there .
1002_199	frank jr.	how about tomorrow ?
1002_200	phoebe	well , that 's not good . but you know , i can move some stuff around , and i 'll be there . you and alice just take the whole day together .
1002_201	frank jr.	you 'd do that for us ?

1002_207	chandler	we have to leave
1002_208	monica	why ? what did you do in the bathroom ?
1002_209	chandler	i didn 't get to the bathroom . i bumped into owen on the way , and he didn 't know he was adopted . and there 's a slight chance i may have told him .
1002_210	monica	oh my god , where 's my purse ? no , you know what ? i can replace everything in there . get that binder , and let 's go

1002_212	colleen	hey .
1002_213	bill	some little snacks for everybody . oh , you don 't have to eat the sour worms . those are for owen .
1002_214	colleen	i 'll go get him in a second . by the way , you should know we haven 't told him he 's adopted yet .
1002_215	chandler	but kids are so intuitive . don 't you think on some level he already knows ?

1002_217	owen	i 'm adopted ?
1002_218	chandler	see ? intuitive
1002_219	bill	what ? where did you hear that ?
1002_220	owen	he told me and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .
1002_221	chandler	which technically now you should give back
1002_222	colleen	you told him he 's adopted ?
1002_223	chandler	i 'm so sorry , but you should have a sign out there or something . or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door . owen doesn 't know he 's adopted , and he also thinks that santa is real .
1002_224	owen	he isn 't ?
1002_225	chandler (to monica)	we have to get out of here , baby

1002_233	joey	dude , are you okay ?
1002_234	ross	totally .
1002_235	rachel	ross , you don 't seem okay .
1002_236	ross (on the verge of tears)	i 'm sorry , it must be the pressure of entertaining . i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan .
1002_237	charlie	wait , ross . ross . i i have to take off .
1002_238	ross	no
1002_239	charlie	i 'm sorry , i have a really early class in the morning , but this has been lovely .
1002_240	ross	wasn 't it ? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel .
1002_241	charlie	you 're on fire i 'll call you in the morning , okay ?
1002_242	ross	okay .
1002_243	charlie	alright .

1004_010	ross	no .
1004_011	rachel	no , that day that won 't be her real birthday
1004_012	chandler	gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was
1004_013	ross	c 'mon you guys , this is really important to us .
1004_014	monica	well , i 'm sorry , but chandler and i could really use a weekend away . you know , to reconnect emotionally .
1004_015	chandler	there 's this thing i really want us to do . i read about it in maxim
1004_016	rachel	well , can 't you just go to vermont the next day ?
1004_017	ross	yeah , we want everyone to be there . as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .
1004_018	rachel	and i mean , you know , you guys this is a big deal . i mean , how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle
1004_019	monica	all right , we 'll stay . we can just drive up after the party .
1004_020	chandler	fine , but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party
1004_021	monica	believe me , that is not why we won 't be doing that

1004_024	rachel	you know pheebs , when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find em all .
1004_025	phoebe	oooh , i love family traditions like that . when uhm when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food
1004_026	ross	hey guys
1004_027	rachel and phoebe	hi
1004_028	ross	hey , i brought the camera for emma 's video .
1004_029	rachel	oh , good , good we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we 'll give it to her when she is 18 .
1004_030	phoebe	oh , cool wow , it 's like a time capsule
1004_031	ross	yeah
1004_032	phoebe	oh , just think she 's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn 't even been invented yet with friends who right now are just like babies and they 'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people
1004_033	ross	that 's the hope so , is emma awake yet ?

1004_056	rachel	look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn 't a really big deal to you , but it really is to us , ok ? emma will never have a first birthday again .
1004_057	monica	all right you 're right . we 're sorry . now let 's wake up emma and get the fun time started

1004_118	rachel	oh , you 're gonna love this cake . i got it from a bakery in new jersey , corinos .
1004_119	monica	oh my god , that place has the creamiest frosting i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
1004_120	rachel	well , anyway , they make these great novelty cakes , in all different shapes , and if you give them a photo , theyll copy it in icing
1004_121	monica	oh , did you do a picture of emma ?
1004_122	rachel	yes on a cake shaped like a bunny .
1004_123	ross	uh , rach ? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ? say for bachelorette parties ?
1004_124	rachel	ross , what are you talking about ? oh oh my god they put my babys face on a penis
1004_125	phoebe (sees the cake)	oh now its a party
1004_126	rachel	why you guys this isn 't funny , all right ? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself
1004_127	joey (staring at the cake)	uh is it ok that i still think it looks delicious ?
1004_128	judy	jack , look at this .
1004_129	jack	i know what you 're thinking judy , the resemblance is uncanny
1004_130	ross	i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
1004_131	rachel (on the phone)	no , no , this is not what i ordered . ok ? i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughters birthday and i need a bunny cake , right now
1004_132	ross	ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babys face off the penis , so we can put it on the bunny . . that is a weird sentence
1004_133	rachel	oh believe you me i am going to bring this cake back , i don 't even want it in my home joey , don 't touch it
1004_134	joey	i 'm so confused

1004_140	monica	oh . so nice of her to pull my hair , till i dropped the key

1004_240	ross	rach , she 's not going to remember this .
1004_241	rachel	i guess oh , i just had such an idea of what this day would be like , you know ? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday . then we would all go into hey get out of the road you stupid student driver they have to learn

1004_243	rachel	what ?
1004_244	ross	it 's not bad .

1004_247	rachel	well , i 'm very impressed .
1004_248	ross	some can sing , some can dance . i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .

1007_004	phoebe	hey
1007_005	ross	hey , what are you doing ?
1007_006	mike	oh , figuring out our wedding plans .
1007_007	chandler	that 's funny , we were doing the same thing
1007_008	ross	yeah
1007_009	phoebe	it 's really crazy the hall , the dress , the food i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was
1007_010	chandler	yeah it is really pricey . i mean , i freaked when i first heard the numbers .
1007_011	phoebe	so what did you two do about it ?
1007_012	chandler	it was pretty simple actually , i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions , wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .
1007_013	ross	there 's no way around it pheebs , you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money .
1007_014	mike	i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry .
1007_015	ross	yeah , and i 'm responsible for just like half of that .
1007_016	phoebe	but really , it does seem like this money could be put to better use ?
1007_017	mike	are you serious ?
1007_018	phoebe	yeah now , how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ?
1007_019	mike	i think it would make me wanna marry you even more .
1007_020	ross	i 've got to say you guys , that 's an incredible gesture
1007_021	chandler	maybe you do that next time you get married
1007_022	ross	no , no , no . the next time it 's gonna be a hawaii at sunset . but maybe the time after that

1007_026	joey	hey
1007_027	chandler	hey
1007_028	joey	what 's going on ?
1007_029	chandler	our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment .
1007_030	monica	we ?
1007_031	chandler	you know you don 't want me to help . you can 't have it both ways
1007_032	joey	hey , is this person who decides whether or not you get a baby ?
1007_033	chandler	kind of . she 's coming by to interview us and see where we live .
1007_034	monica	and it has to go perfectly , because if she doesn 't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .
1007_035	joey	hey , maybe i should stop by she could be a soap opera fan it 's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity .
1007_036	chandler	little people ?
1007_037	joey	celebrity .
1007_038	monica	ok , so i think i 'm just about done here , unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere , like porn or cigarettes ?
1007_039	chandler	what ? no
1007_040	monica	chandler ?
1007_041	chandler	i don 't , and i 'm offended by the insinuation
1007_042	monica	ok , so there 's not a magazine under the couch , or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank , or a filthy video in the vcr ?
1007_043	chandler	i 'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine , but that tape is not mine .
1007_044	monica	it isn 't mine
1007_045	joey	well , i guess we 'll never know whose it is

1008_048	rachel	oh phoebe , all babies are beautiful
1008_049	phoebe	oh okay .
1008_050	rachel	phoebe , just the idea of pitting one baby against another , i mean , you know , and judging who 's cuter just for a trophy
1008_051	rachel	and a thousand dollars .
1008_052	rachel	is something i 'm very interested in oh please , do not tell ross . he still believes that what 's in the inside is important
1008_053	phoebe	okay , oh , and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .
1008_054	rachel	where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?
1008_055	phoebe	well , i was thinking

1008_057	phoebe	yeah

1008_060	monica	did someone drop the baton again ?

1008_064	monica	you don 't know that .
1008_065	chandler	somebody is gonna pick us .
1008_066	monica	yeah , but we haven 't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks

1008_068	monica	name one of his books .
1008_069	chandler	the firm ?
1008_070	monica	ok , let 's see uhm , okay , the turkey is in the oven , the stuffing is ready
1008_071	chandler	you know , you always cook this meal all by yourself . let me help this year .
1008_072	monica	oh , chandler , that 's sweet . but you don 't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .
1008_073	chandler	i 'm serious , let me do something , just not the turkey or the stuffing , nothing high profile .
1008_074	monica	ok , let 's see oh , the cranberry sauce , it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it .
1008_075	chandler	tell me more .
1008_076	monica	okay , i 'm gonna go check on something across the hall . you start by washing these not with soap

1008_091	joey	so we 'll leave before it 's over , we 'll be back in time .
1008_092	chandler	you say that now , but it could take us a long time to get back home . plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .
1008_093	joey	dude , two times that happened
1008_094	chandler	look , monica has been working hard all day , she didn 't wanna host this thing in the first place , we shouldn 't go

1009_141	chandler	so , the fact that i am a doctor , and my wifes a reverend , thats important to you ?
1009_142	erica	yeah , i read some great applications , but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child
1009_143	monica	amen .
1009_144	chandler	plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor
1009_145	monica	uh , good hands . healing hands .
1009_146	erica	reverend , can i ask ? does the bible say anything about adoption ?
1009_147	monica	it says do it . and behold she did adopt onto them a baby . and it was good .
1009_148	erica	wow .
1009_149	chandler	yeah , wow .
1009_150	erica	i was wondering you both have such serious jobs . would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?
1009_151	monica	oh , you know , my flock is good , i mean , yeah , my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point . good flock . flock , flock , flock .

1009_182	ross	oh , i see , somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?

1009_195	chandler	your veal chop is $ 34,95
1009_196	monica	c 'mon chandler , i think we have been given an opportunity . i mean , the mistake has already been made . they are writing up the paper right now .
1009_197	chandler	but we are not the one she chose how can you feel okay about this ?
1009_198	monica	because we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us .
1009_199	chandler	i know
1009_200	monica	i mean , who knows how long it 's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ? what if , what if no one ever picks us ?
1009_201	chandler	oh , honey

1009_283	chandler	the agency must have made some mistake . my wife is not a reverend and i 'm not a doctor .
1009_284	erica	what ?
1009_285	agency guy	that 's impossible .
1009_286	chandler	i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you 'd like .
1009_287	agency guy	i 'll go check your file . excuse me .
1009_288	erica	so who are you ?
1009_289	chandler	well , our names really are monica and chandler . we 're from new york .
1009_290	monica	yeah , but the important thing to know about us , is how much we would care for this little baby .
1009_291	erica	so you lied to me before ?
1009_292	monica	well , we bore false witness see i could be a reverend .
1009_293	erica	i can 't believe this .
1009_294	monica	but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider
1009_295	erica	giving you my baby ? you think i 'd give you my child after this ?
1009_296	monica	well , you don 't have to decide right now , but if you could just look at our file

1009_299	chandler	erica wait
1009_300	erica	i 've nothing to say to you .
1009_301	chandler	you have every reason to be upset . we did lie . but only because we 've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long . now we don 't know how long it 's gonna be before we can get another chance again .
1009_302	erica	why don 't you ask the reverend to pray on it ?

1013_196	chandler	yeah , i 've been to these places before , but i 've never really seen them , you know .
1013_197	monica	yeah , you miss alot , when you 're moo-ing .
1013_198	erica	thanks so much for showing me around .
1013_199	monica	oh it was our pleasure . we are so much enjoying getting to know you .
1013_200	erica	well , if there is anything else you wanna know
1013_201	chandler	oh , uhm , okay , uhm , do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father ?
1013_202	erica	oh , sure . yeah , well , he was my high school boyfriend . captain of the football team , really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .
1013_203	chandler	that 's great .
1013_204	erica	yeah it 's almost definitely him .
1013_205	monica	how 's that now ?
1013_206	erica	well , there is a chance it 's another guy . i mean , i have only ever been with two guys , but they sorta overlapped .
1013_207	chandler	so , what does the other guy do ? does he go to college too ?
1013_208	erica	no , he 's in prison .
1013_209	monica	was he falsely accused of something ?
1013_210	erica	no he killed his father with a shovel . but other than that , he 's a great guy .
1013_211	chandler	i 'll bet his dad doesn 't think so .

1013_213	monica	are you awake ?
1013_214	chandler	of course i 'm awake . assume from now on that i 'm always awake
1013_215	monica	alright , we don 't know that it 's him . i mean , it could be the football guy .
1013_216	chandler	honey , it 's us . of course it 's the shovel-killer .
1013_217	monica	alright , lets say that it is him , would we not want the baby ? no would we treat him any differently ?
1013_218	chandler	i 'd keep an eye on him we have to find out which one the father is .
1013_219	monica	how ?
1013_220	chandler	i dunno , aren 't there tests for these things , right ?
1013_221	monica	yeah , but maybe we 're just over-reacting .
1013_222	chandler	pff , easy for you to say , he 's a father killer . he probably loves him mommy . he 's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm

1013_225	tape	we will now count from one to five . un , deux , trois , quatre , cinq .
1013_226	joey	huh , un , blu , bla , flu , flenk

1013_242	ross	hey rach , can you grab me a cup of coffee ?

1013_249	rachel	fyi

1013_251	rachel	in the future , when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex just do it .
1013_252	ross	wait , wait , you 're mad at me about last night ? i was just trying to do the right thing .
1013_253	rachel	really ? well , it seems to me if you 'd done the right thing , i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed , i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied
1013_254	ross	well
1013_255	rachel	oh stop that
1013_256	ross	i can 't believe this . i was just being a good guy . i treated you with respect and understanding .
1013_257	rachel	oh , that is so hot . she walks around him to the other side
1013_258	ross	hey , i was looking out for you .
1013_259	rachel	oh , really , well ross , you know what ? i am a big girl . i don 't need someone telling me what is best for me .
1013_260	ross	i gotta say , i have not had sex a lot of times before , this is the worst ever .
1013_261	rachel	oh , really , really ? well , it wasn 't very good for me either .
1013_262	ross	hey you know what ? you know what ? to avoid this little thing in the future , let 's just say , you and me , never having sex again .
1013_263	rachel	what ?
1013_264	ross	that 's right , sex is off the table . i am never having sex with you again . dr. green , are you feeling better ?

1013_267	chandler	hey how was lunch ?
1013_268	erica	we had a good time . by the way , i wanted to ask you something . it would really mean a lot to me , if the baby was a boy , that you name him after my father , jiminy billy bob
1013_269	chandler	oh , really ?
1013_270	erica	no you we 're right , that was fun i 'm gonna go finish packing .
1013_271	chandler	o-okay . so , is she gonna take the test ?
1013_272	monica	nope , she doesn 't have to , i found out who the father is .
1013_273	chandler	oh god . it 's shovely-joe , isn 't it ?
1013_274	monica	no it 's not .
1013_275	chandler	how do you know ?
1013_276	erica	well , it turns out that erica didn 't pay much attention in sex ed class , because the thing she did with that prison guy it 'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way .
1013_277	chandler	oh god what was it ? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do ?
1013_278	monica	the thing we never do .
1013_279	chandler	shovely joe

1015_050	chandler	what do you think pheebs ?

1015_052	chandler	yeah .
1015_053	phoebe	she died .

1015_059	monica	joey 's gonna be so upset .
1015_060	chandler	i know . he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .
1015_061	phoebe	well , we cannot tell joey about this . he 's already flipping out about everything that 's changing . this will push him over the edge .
1015_062	monica	seriously , you don 't think we should tell him ?
1015_063	phoebe	well , not for a little while . let 's just give him a few days to get used to everything else .
1015_064	monica	what if he reads it in the paper ?
1015_065	chandler	unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we 're okay .

1015_067	ross	yeah , i 'm a friend of rachel green 's . uhm , actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago .
1015_068	mr zelner	oh right , uhm , don ?

1015_072	mr zelner	ah , did she ask you to come here and do this ?
1015_073	ross	oh , no . at first i have to get you to agree . then we 'll see if she wants to come back .
1015_074	mr zelner	wow , that is tempting .
1015_075	ross	look , she loved her job here . and let 's face it you 're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it . isn 't that true ?

1015_122	rachel	oh , youre not gonna believe what happened to me today ralph lauren called , and gave me my job back
1015_123	ross	nooo
1015_124	rachel	yee . i mean , it was so weirdest thing . they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back i mean , that place must have been falling apart without me .
1015_125	ross	so , youre not going to paris .
1015_126	rachel	no , im still going .
1015_127	ross	wh whwhat ?
1015_128	rachel	when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back , the offered me more money isnt that great ?
1015_129	ross	yeeeah

1015_132	lady	oh , sure . im showing it to someone else right now , but please , look around .
1015_133	monica	thanks .
1015_134	chandler	it feels like were cheating on our house . and if were gonna cheat , shouldnt it be with like a hot , younger house , that does stuff that our house wont do ?
1015_135	monica	ours is so much better this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave what a hole
1015_136	lady	so ? what do you think ?
1015_137	monica	love it
1015_138	lady	well , we already have one offer on it , and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .
1015_139	monica	they could be our neighbors , what are they like ?
1015_140	lady	oh , the woman upstairs is very nice . she and her husband have two kids , he 's on wall street and she
1015_141	janice	oh my god

1015_143	chandler (to monica)	sure .

1015_145	phoebe	hey joey , want come with me to are you ok ?
1015_146	joey	yeah , i just i just feel bad about firing estelle . this is got to be killing her .
1015_147	phoebe	no , that wouldnt kill her . ordinary embolism might .
1015_148	joey	i dont know . shes got to be taking it hard , i was like her only client . except for this guy who eats paper . and im guessing he eats more money than he makes . look , i know shes not a great agent , but she did stick with me for ten years . im gonna
1015_149	phoebe	no , no , no don 't call her you wait for her to call you
1015_150	joey	why ?
1015_151	phoebe	because patience is the road to understanding which is the key to a happy heart .
1015_152	joey	you blow me away .
1015_153	phoebe	all right , so promise you 're gonna wait for her to call you ?
1015_154	joey	i promise . and that means , never having to give a reason .

1015_157	chandler	and yet i never run into beyonce
1015_158	realtor	you two know each other ?
1015_159	janice	oh , we go way back . before monica made an honest man out of him , chandler used to be my little love muffin . so ? are you guys thinking of getting this house too ? ooh are we gonna have a bidding war ? i 'd better warn you , i 'm a toughie
1015_160	chandler	don 't , don 't
1015_161	monica	no , actually , we 're buying the house next door .
1015_162	chandler	why ?
1015_163	monica	i d on 't know why .
1015_164	janice	ooh , that decides it then . i was on the fence . but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ? ah now we have to get it ellen , we 're going to talk numbers .
1015_165	chandler	this can not be happening
1015_166	monica	okay , the realtor said another couple made an offer . maybe the janice 's won 't get it maybe the other couple will .
1015_167	chandler	the only way that that is going to happen , is if the other couple are the hitlers .
1015_168	monica	okay , okay , all right . what if we got both houses ? huh ? we can turn this house into a guest house .
1015_169	chandler	that is a great idea and by the way , i don 't mean to sound distasteful , but when did you start crapping money ?
1015_170	monica	okay , you come up with an idea .
1015_171	chandler	alright alright , we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house . we can still get out .
1015_172	monica	but we love our house .
1015_173	chandler	will we love it so much with her next door ? and she 's gonna be louder out here too . just the crickets and oh my god
1015_174	monica	okay , but if we don 't get this house , she 's stil gonna show up wherever we go i mean , at least if she 's here , it eliminates the element of suprise . i mean , never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body
1015_175	chandler	well , we have to do something . we can 't have her living next door . oh , that does it too .

1015_178	r zelner	who is it ?
1015_179	ross	it 's me . ron . look , i um , i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back .
1015_180	mr zelner	this may surprise you , but re-hiring fired employees , is not my main job .
1015_181	ross	just hear me out . how would you feel about offering her a raise ?
1015_182	mr zelner	not good , ron .
1015_183	ross	perhaps i can persuade you . what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica .
1015_184	mr zelner	wow , that 's pretty cool
1015_185	ross	huh ? so ? we have a deal ?
1015_186	mr zelner	okay , you got it .
1015_187	ross	yes yes
1015_188	mr zelner	this is gonna make me very popular .
1015_189	ross	oh , believe me , the ladies , they love it
1015_190	mr zelner	i meant with my son .
1015_191	ross	good , cause the ladies , not so much .

1015_218	janice	i don 't know what to say i mean , you know , obviously we have this heat between us .
1015_219	chandler	obviously .
1015_220	janice	but i love my husband . and i know you love your wife . now , i don 't think we should get this house now .
1015_221	chandler	don 't say that . don 't tangle the dream and take it away .
1015_222	janice	chandler , one of us has got to be strong .
1015_223	chandler	i understand .

1016_222	joey	all right , let 's think about this . i mean , there 's got to be an explanation . uh did you do anything to make her mad ?
1016_223	ross	no , i don 't think so .
